You can use alpha features to learn about upcoming changes, try them out, and share feedback.

:::info
To understand the difference between an alpha feature and an alpha release, see [alpha features and releases](http://localhost:3000/docs/next/reference/release-policy.md#alpha-features-and-releases).

### Alpha

Selected Camunda features and components are released as **alpha** versions. We release these in an early state for you to test and participate in development by sharing your feedback before they reach [general availability (GA)](#general-availability-ga).

Limitations of alpha features and components include:

- Not for production use.
- APIs, dependencies, and configuration are likely to change.
- Not necessarily feature-complete.
- Might lack full documentation.
- No guaranteed updates to newer releases.
- Support based on SLAs agreed with you, but bugs are treated with the same priority as feature or help requests.
- No maintenance service.
- (SaaS) No availability targets.
- Released outside the standard [release policy](/reference/release-policy.md).

To learn more about using alpha features, see [enabling alpha features](/components/console/manage-organization/enable-alpha-features.md).

:::note
Although there is no maintenance service, customers can still provide feedback through designated support channels, depending on their SLAs. These channels include filing issues in the respective [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/camunda) and by submitting questions and suggestions by [contacting us](/contact).
:::

### General availability (GA)

Once features and components are released and considered stable, they become generally available.

Stable features and components are:

- Allowed for production use.
- Fully documented and supported.

A release or component is considered stable if it has passed all stages of verification and tests and can be released to production.

:::note
Alpha releases can also have **limited availability**, such as features that are only available to enterprise customers.
