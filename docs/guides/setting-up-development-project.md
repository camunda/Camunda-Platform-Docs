title: Setting up your first development project
---

Let's set up your first project to model, deploy, and start a process instance.

The [camunda-cloud-get-started GitHub repository](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/camunda-cloud-get-started)
contains a hands-on guide for setting up a Camunda Cloud project locally.

The guide offers a general walk-through on how to model, deploy, and start a
process instance. It also includes code examples on how to connect to the
cluster and complete jobs.
