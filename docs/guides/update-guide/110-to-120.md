The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Cloud 1.1.x to 1.2.0 for each component of the system.

:::caution

 We identified an issue in our recent release of Zeebe 1.2 related to our
 concept of processing on followers. Version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 are affected by a
 bug, resulting in an inconsistent state
 ([#8044](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/issues/8044)).

 Therefore we recommend updating to 1.2.4 directly.

## Server

### Operate

With Operate 1.2, a new feature was introduced to quickly navigate a call
activity hierarchy. This feature is only available for instances started after
the version 1.2 update. Older instances will not expose this information to the
user.
