Connectors are operated as part of the Connector runtime, which is provided for SaaS and Self-Managed environments.

When using Camunda Platform 8 SaaS, the Connector runtime is operated by Camunda and offered in the scope of the product. In this environment, you can use the [out-of-the-box Connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md) provided by Camunda.

Looking to create your own [runtime logic](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md#runtime-logic) or [runtime environments](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md#runtime-environments)? Check out the [Connector SDK](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md).
