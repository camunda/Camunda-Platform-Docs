# Overview

Element templates are a way to extend [Desktop Modeler](https://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/) with domain-specific diagram elements, such as service and user tasks.

If applicable, element templates can be assigned to a diagram element via the properties panel.
Once applied, element templates configure the diagram element with pre-defined values for BPMN properties, input/output mappings, and extension properties.

As seen in the _Mail Task_ example above, Modeler allows properties of custom elements to be edited, too.
