Two key metrics that play a role in the paid plans are the number of started process instances and the number of claimed user tasks. To view these metrics across the organization, the **Organization Management** for trial plans provide a usage view for them.

Both metrics are aggregated on a monthly basis and displayed in the Usage History.
