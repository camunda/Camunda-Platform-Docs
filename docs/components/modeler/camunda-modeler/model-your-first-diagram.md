title: Model your first diagram

After [downloading](./install-the-modeler.md), setting up, and starting Camunda Modeler, you can model your first BPMN diagram. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a new BPMN diagram:

![empty application](./img/empty.png)

2. View the BPMN diagram with a start event:

![new diagram](./img/new-diagram.png)

As with [Cloud Modeler](../cloud-modeler/model-your-first-diagram.md), you can now add new elements.

3. On the left side of the screen you will find the element palette supported by the engine. Drag and drop the elements into the diagram:

![elements](./img/elements.png)

Elements that support different types can be reconfigured by clicking on the corresponding icon. In the following screenshot, a task has been added to the diagram. It can be converted to a service task, for example.

![task configuration](img/element-configuration.png)

4. Each element has adjustable attributes. Use the properties panel on the right side of the page:

5. Once you finish modeling and configuring your diagram, save it as BPMN or deploy it on a [Camunda Cloud cluster](./connect-to-camunda-cloud.md). You can also export the diagram as an image.
