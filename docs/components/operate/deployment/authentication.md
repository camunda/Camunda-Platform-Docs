description: "Let's take a closer look at how Operate authenticates for use."
---

Operate provides three ways to authenticate:

1. User information stored in [Elasticsearch](#user-in-elasticsearch).
2. [Camunda Cloud single sign-on](#camunda-cloud-single-sign-on).
3. [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](#ldap).

By default, user storage in Elasticsearch is enabled.

## User in Elasticsearch

In this mode, the user authenticates with a username and password stored in Elasticsearch.

The **Username** and **password** for one user may be set in `application.yml`:

```
camunda.operate:
  username: anUser
  password: aPassword
```

On startup of Operate, the user is created if they did not exist before.

By default, one user with **username**/**password** `demo`/`demo` is created.

Add more users directly to Elasticsearch via the index `operate-user-<version>_`. The password must be encoded with a strong `bcrypt` hashing function.

## Camunda Cloud single sign-on

Currently, Operate supports single sign-on (SSO) in the Camunda Cloud environment. Camunda Cloud handles the configuration of Operate for SSO, so you don't need to normally adjust the following subsections.

### Enable SSO

SSO can only be enabled by setting the [Spring profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles): `sso-auth`.

See the following example:

```
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=sso-auth
```

### Configure SSO

SSO requires the following parameters:

Parameter name | Description
--------------|-------------
camunda.operate.auth0.domain | Defines the domain the user sees.
camunda.operate.auth0.backendDomain | Defines the domain which provides user information.
camunda.operate.auth0.clientId | Similar to a username for the application.
camunda.operate.auth0.clientSecret | Similar to a password for the application.
camunda.operate.auth0.claimName | The claim checked by Operate. Similar to a permission name.
camunda.operate.auth0.organization | The given organization should be contained in the value of the claim name.

See the following example for setting parameters as environment variables:

```
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=A_DOMAIN
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_AUTH0_BACKENDDOMAIN=A_BACKEND_DDOMAIN
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_AUTH0_CLIENTID=A_CLIENT_ID
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_AUTH0_CLIENTSECRET=A_SECRET
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_AUTH0_CLAIMNAME=A_CLAIM
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_AUTH0_ORGANIZATION=AN_ORGANIZATION
```

## LDAP

### Enable LDAP

LDAP can only be enabled by setting the [Spring profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles): `ldap-auth`.

See the following example for setting the Spring profile as an environmental variable:

```
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=ldap-auth
```

### Configuration of LDAP

A user can authenticate via LDAP.

The following parameters for connection to an LDAP server should be given:

 Parameter name | Description | Example | Required
 --------------|------------|---------|--------
 camunda.operate.ldap.url | URL to an LDAP Server | ldaps://camunda.com/ | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.baseDn| Base domain name | dc=camunda,dc=com| Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.managerDn| Manager domain used by Operate to log into LDAP server to retrieve user information | cn=admin,dc=camunda,dc=com| Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.managerPassword| Password for manager| | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.userSearchFilter| Filter to retrieve user info. The pattern '{0}' is replaced by the given username in the login form. | {0} | No, default is {0}
 camunda.operate.ldap.userSearchBase| Starting point for search | ou=Support,dc=camunda,dc=com | No

### Configuration of active directory-based LDAP

For an **active directory**-based LDAP server, the following parameters should be given:

:::note
The active directory configuration will only be applied when `camunda.operate.ldap.domain` is given.
:::

 Parameter name | Description | Required |
 --------------|------------|---------
 camunda.operate.ldap.url | URL to an active directory LDAP server | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.domain| Domain | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.baseDn| Root domain name | No
 camunda.operate.ldap.userSearchFilter| Used as a search filter | No
