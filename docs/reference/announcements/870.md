## Web Modeler Deploy diagram change <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span>

With this version, we ship a breaking change to how Web Modeler **Deploy diagram** modals work. Clusters must now be proactively [configured](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from Web Modeler.

- In 8.6, you could still configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal when deploying.
- In 8.7, you can no longer configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal. You must [configure the cluster](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from this modal.
- Note that you must also be assigned the `Zeebe` [Identity role](/docs/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-role.md) to be able to deploy.

## Installation and deployment updates <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span>

### Helm charts

If you are using the recommended Camunda 8 deployment option (Helm charts), the upgrade path from version 8.6 to 8.7 will be straightforward by changing the values file to the new syntax.

New migration guides will also be provided to support you when migrating from a previous Camunda version.

:::caution
Additional upgrade considerations are necessary for deployments that use custom scripts, such as Docker containers, manual installations, or custom-developed Kubernetes deployments. For these deployments, customers can either continue to deploy with their original 8.6 topology and upgrade each component independently, or adopt our Helm Chart approach for the upgrade, which allows for unifying the deployment into a single JAR or container executable.

### Manual installation

<!-- TBD, pending report back from Immi -->

For organizations that do not use cloud-native platforms such as Kubernetes or container services, we will publish a reference architecture that provides guidance on implementing Camunda production clusters on VM-based systems, using Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 as an example.

The architecture will include details on optimal instance sizing, network configurations, and security best practices, to ensure robust performance and reliability.

## Southeast Asia region for SaaS customers <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

SaaS customers can now create orchestration clusters in the [Singapore (asia-southeast1) region](/reference/regions.md), ensuring lower latency and improved processing speed for organizations operating in southeast Asian countries.
