This section gives an overview of the **Connectors** available in Camunda Cloud:

- [Rest Connector](rest.md) - allows you to make a request to a REST API and use the response in the next steps of your process.
- [Sendgrid Connector](sendgrid.md) - allows you to quickly and easily send emails from your BPMN processes.

In addition to these sections, you may also be interested in how to configure [Connectors Secrets](../../../../console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md).
