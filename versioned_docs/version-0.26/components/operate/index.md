In addition to providing visibility into active and completed workflow instances, Operate also makes it possible to carry out key operations such as resolving <!-- FIXME: [incidents](/reference/incidents.html) --> incidents and updating workflow instance variables.

In the [Operate User Guide](userguide/basic-operate-navigation) you can find out how to use it to monitor workflow instances and more features.

In the [Operate Deployment Guide](deployment/install-and-start) you can walk through how to install and run Operate. 

Operate is also available for production use (with support) in the Camunda Cloud offering.
If you'd like try out Operate in the Camunda Cloud, [please sign up here.](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup)

Because Operate can be a helpful tool when getting started with Zeebe and building an initial proof of concept, we make it available under a developer license for **free, non-production use**. [You can find the developer license here](https://zeebe.io/legal/operate-evaluation-license/). There are no restrictions under this license when it comes to the length of the evaluation period or the available feature set _as long as you use Operate in non-production environments only._
