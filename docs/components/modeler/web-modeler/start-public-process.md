<span class="badge badge--cloud">Camunda Platform 8 only</span>

The Camunda Platform now offers a convenient solution for process developers who want to make their processes accessible to users without requiring them to sign up on the platform or understand how tasks work.

With this feature, developers can easily publish a process with a form embedded into the start event and enable a public link that can be shared with anyone.
Users can simply open the link, fill out the form, and submit it to initiate a process instance.

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to leverage this auto-generated frontend to streamline process initiation and improve user adoption.
