## Overview

The processes section gives you an overview of all the processes and their status on a single page.
This section also allows you to set a process owner to take responsibility of a process and time goals to track process performance.

## Assigning an owner

Assign an owner for process health to clarify who the responsible individual is for it. Once you open up the set owner modal, select one of the users in your organization to be the main person responsible for the process.

Once an owner is assigned to a process, you can sort the processes page by owner to quickly see which processes have a common owner.

## Set and track time-based goals

Setting duration goals on a process makes it easier to quickly see its health overtime; it is also useful to track the result of any improvements made on the process.

Once you open up the modal, youâ€™re met with two goals: a target goal and an SLA goal for process instance duration. The target goal assumes 75% of your process instances follow your "happy path" (the default scenario with a positive outcome) or can automatically be resolved entirely. In contrast, the SLA goal ensures you can still guarantee your customers how long a process should take while excluding outliers, even if human intervention is required.

Once you set the goals, you can see their status saved to the **Processes** page. First, sort by goal status to identify the processes that need the most attention, then hover over the goal status to quickly gain insight into their performance.
