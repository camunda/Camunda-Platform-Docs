Use early access releases to quickly learn about upcoming features and components.

## Types of early access releases

Selected Camunda features and components are released upfront as alpha or beta versions, to provide users the opportunity to test a feature and participate in the development by giving feedback prior to market launch (general availability, GA).

Early access releases are made available outside of the [release policy](/reference/release-policy.md).

### Alpha

Alpha features and components are introduced to gather early feedback from users. These features and components are still under heavy development, and are expected to change. These releases are intended only for non-production usages in trying out recent, potentially yet unfinished new features. Characteristics are:

- Not for production use
- APIs, dependencies and configuration are likely to change
- Not necessarily feature-complete
- May not be documented
- Updatability to a newer release not guaranteed
- Support based on SLAs agreed with you, but bugs are treated with the same priority as feature or help requests
- No maintenance service
- On SaaS: no availability targets

### Beta

The scope of beta features and components is close enough to the targeted GA release that we are willing to provide update support, but we're still making the final changes. Therefore, it may still be missing some features. It comes with the same characteristics as an alpha release, except for the following differences:

- APIs, dependencies and configuration are not likely to change
- Potentially feature-complete
- Can usually be updated to a newer release

:::note

Even though there is no maintenance service, customers can still provide feedback depending on their SLAs, such as through their designated support channels, filing issues in the respective [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/camunda), as well as by submitting questions and suggestions in the [Camunda Forum](https://forum.camunda.io/).

### General Availability (GA)

All features and components launched on the market that are not considered early access are considered generally available. Characteristics are:

- Allowed for production use
- Fully documented and supported

:::note

There are also early access releases with **limited availability**, such as features that are only available to enterprise customers.
