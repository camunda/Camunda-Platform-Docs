title: Update 8.7 to 8.8
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to Camunda 8.8.0."

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to 8.8.x for each component.

## Removed deprecated OpenAPI objects

In previous releases we gradually transformed our entity keys from `number (int64)` to `string` types while still
providing users the opportunity to keep using the deprecated versions.

:::warning
With this release we removed the already deprecated API objects containing number keys and with that, the corresponding
`application/vnd.camunda.api.keys.number+json` content type header, too.
:::

If you were still using API objects with number keys in the previous version, then you need to update them to the new
objects and use the `application/json` header.  
You can find more about the key attribute type change in the [8.7 overview about API Key Attributes][camunda8-api-overview].
