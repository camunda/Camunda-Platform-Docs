```java
        ...
        final String jobType = "foo";

        try (final ZeebeClient client = clientBuilder.build()) {

            System.out.println("Opening job worker.");

            try (final JobWorker workerRegistration =
                client
                    .newWorker()
                    .jobType(jobType)
                    .handler(new ExampleJobHandler())
                    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                    .open()) {
                System.out.println("Job worker opened and receiving jobs.");

                // run until System.in receives exit command
                waitUntilSystemInput("exit");
            }
        }
    }

    private static class ExampleJobHandler implements JobHandler {
        @Override
        public void handle(final JobClient client, final ActivatedJob job) {
            // here: business logic that is executed with every job
            System.out.println(job);
            client.newCompleteCommand(job.getKey()).send().join();
        }
    }
