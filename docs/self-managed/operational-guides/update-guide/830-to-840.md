### Dockerfile Now Uses Numeric ID Instead of a Non-numeric User

The Dockerfile now uses a numeric user ID instead of a non-numeric user.
This will allow the helm users to use `runAsNonRoot=true` without the need to explicitly set the ID in the Helm values.yaml file.

:::caution
If you experience permission errors on data or log volumes access when updating to 8.4.0, you may need to make sure mounted volumes and existing files are writable by this user.

In a [kubernetes setup this can be done by setting the fsGroup](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#configure-volume-permission-and-ownership-change-policy-for-pods) to 1001. Newer versions of the Camunda Helm chart have this is set by default

In a non-kubernetes setup, such as a Docker compose setup for example, this can be done running the following command:

```
find / -user 1000 -exec chown 1001 {} \;
```

For more details and alternatives please refer to the [Camunda Helm Update instructions](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/upgrade.md#v83).
