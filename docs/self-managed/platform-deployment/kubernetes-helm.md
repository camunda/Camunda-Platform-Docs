Camunda provides contionously improved Helm charts that are available here: [Camunda Platform Helm Charts](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm). Those Helm charts are not cloud provider-specific, so you can choose your Kubernetes provider.

We encourage [reporting issues](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/issues) if you find them.


## What is Helm?

[Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) is a package manager for Kubernetes resources. Helm allows us to install a set of components by simply referencing a package name, and allowing us to override configurations to accommodate these packages to different scenarios.

Helm also provides dependency management between charts, meaning that charts can depend on other charts. This allows us to aggregate a set of components together that can be installed with a single command. 

## Components installed by the Helm charts

By default, the following will be installed:

- **Camunda Platform 8 self-managed Helm (ccsm-helm)**:  
  - **Zeebe**: Deploys a Zeebe Cluster with three brokers using the `camunda/zeebe` docker image.
  - **Zeebe Gateway**: Deploys the standalone Zeebe Gateway with two replicas.
  - **Operate**: Deploys Operate, which connects to an existing Elasticsearch.
  - **Tasklist**: Deploys the Tasklist component to work with user tasks.
  - **Optimize**: Deploys the Optimize component to analyze the historic process executions.
  - **Identity**: Deploys the Identity component responsible for authentication and authorization.
  - **Elasticsearch**: Deploys an Elasticsearch cluster with two nodes.

When installing the [camunda-platform](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/tree/main/charts/camunda-platform) Helm chart, all the components in this picture are installed.

## How to install Camunda 8 using Helm

### Add Camunda Helm repository

You have to add the Camunda Helm chart repository in order to use the charts. Once this is done, Helm is able to fetch and install charts hosted in [http://helm.camunda.io](http://helm.camunda.io):

```
> helm repo add camunda https://helm.camunda.io
> helm repo update
```

Once this is complete, we are ready to install the Helm chart hosted in the official Camunda Helm chart repo. 


### Installing the Camunda Helm chart in a Cloud environment

To install the available Camunda Platform 8 components inside a Kubernetes cluster, you can simply run: 

```
> helm install <RELEASE NAME> camunda/camunda-platform
```

:::note
Change &gt;RELEASE NAME&lt; with a name of your choice.

Also, notice that you can add the `-n` flag to specify in which Kubernetes namespace the components should be installed.
:::

Notice that this Kubernetes cluster can have services which are already running; Camunda components are simply installed as another set of services. 

Installing all the components in a cluster requires all Docker images to be downloaded to the remote cluster. Depending on which Cloud provider you are using, the amount of time it will take to fetch all the images will vary.

Review the progress of your deployment by checking if the Kubernetes PODs are up and running with the following:

```
> kubectl get pods
```

This will return something similar to the following:

```
NAME                                           READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE

```

### Installing the Camunda Helm chart locally using KIND

If you want to use [Kubernetes KIND](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind), add `-f camunda-platform-core-kind-values.yaml`. The file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/kind/camunda-platform-core-kind-values.yaml).



Be aware, that using KIND is only recommended for development purposes.

```
helm install <RELEASE NAME> camunda-cloud/camunda-platform -f camunda-platform-core-kind-values.yaml
```

This will deploy the same components, but with a set of parameters tailored to a local environment setup.

:::note
All Docker images will be downloaded to your local KIND cluster, so it might take some time for the services to get started.
:::

Review the progress of your deployment by checking if the Kubernetes PODs are up and running with the following:

```
> kubectl get pods
```


This will return something similar to the following:

```
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
elasticsearch-master-0                                 1/1     Running   0          4m6s
<RELEASE NAME>-operate-XXX                           1/1     Running   0          4m6s
<RELEASE NAME>-zeebe-0                                 1/1     Running   0          4m6s
<RELEASE NAME>-tasklist-XXX                          1/1     Running   0          4m6s
<RELEASE NAME>-zeebe-gateway                           1/1     Running   0          4m6s
```

### Troubleshooting the installation

Check that each pod has at least 1/1 running instances. If one or more of your pods stay pending, it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node. Usually this happens because there are insufficient resources that prevent it. Use the `kubectl describe ...` command to check on messages from the scheduler:

```
> kubectl describe pods ${POD_NAME}
```

If the output of the `describe` command was not beneficial, tail the logs of these pods by running the following:

```
> kubectl logs -f <POD NAME> 
```
