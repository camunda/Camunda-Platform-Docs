Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed is highly customizable and can be deployed in different setups. This section highlights various use cases and scenarios of configuring Camunda Platform 8 beyond the default values.

Each guide is considered complete and standalone use case, however, make sure to view the [Deploying Camunda Platform 8 using Helm charts](../deploy.md) page which is the base for all guides.
