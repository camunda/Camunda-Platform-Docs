In addition to providing visibility into active and completed process instances, Operate also makes it possible to carry out key operations such as resolving [incidents](./userguide/resolve-incidents-update-variables.md), and updating process instance variables.

Learn how to use Operate to monitor process instances and more features in the [Operate user guide](/components/operate/userguide/basic-operate-navigation.md).

Operate is also available for production use (with support) in the Camunda Platform 8 offering.

To try out Operate in Camunda Platform 8, sign up [here](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup).

Because Operate can be a helpful tool when getting started with Zeebe and building an initial proof of concept, we make it available under the [Operate trial license](https://camunda.com/legal/terms/cloud-terms-and-conditions/general-terms-and-conditions-for-the-operate-trial-version/). There are no restrictions under this license when it comes to the length of the evaluation period or the available feature set _as long as you use Operate in non-production environments only._
