# Media pre-sources

This folder contains files that are used to produce [media sources](../media-src/) (e.g. images, videos, etc). Typically for this repo, it contains the BPMN files which are used to produce process images that themselves are displayed on these docs.

These pre-sources should not be hosted by the Docusaurus server, which is why they recide in a different folder.
