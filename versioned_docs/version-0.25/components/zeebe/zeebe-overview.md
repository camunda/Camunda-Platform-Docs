### Zeebe is a cloud-native workflow engine for microservices orchestration

- Define workflows graphically in BPMN 2.0
- Choose any gRPC-supported programming language
- Deploy with Docker and Kubernetes (in the cloud or on-premises)
- Build workflows that react to events from Apache Kafka and other messaging platforms
- Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput
- Fault tolerance (no relational database required)
- Export workflow data for monitoring and analysis
- Engage with an active community
