# `theme` Customizations

This folder contains Camunda's customizations to the Docusaurus classic theme.

Components are generated here by [swizzling](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling). Any swizzled components in the folder override Docusaurus's implementation of that component.

In order to better track our customizations, each swizzled component should contain a comment answering the following two questions:

1. Why is the component swizzled?
2. Which Docusaurus version was it swizzled from?
