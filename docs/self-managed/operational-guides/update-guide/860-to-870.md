title: Update 8.6 to 8.7
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.6.x to Camunda 8.7.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.6.x to 8.7.x for each component.

## Backup

### Google Cloud Storage

Configuring a non-existing bucket for backups will not prevent Zeebe to start up anymore and will only result
in logs (at WARN) in the startup phase.

## Exported records

### `USER_TASK` records

To support User Task Listeners, some backward incompatible changes were necessary to the exported `USER_TASK` records.

#### `assignee` no longer provided in `CREATING/CREATED` events

Previously, when a user task was activating with a specified `assignee`,
we appended the following events of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `CREATED` with `assignee` property as provided

The `ASSIGNING` and `ASSIGNED` events were not appended in this case.

To support the new User Task Listeners feature, the `assignee` value will not be filled in the `CREATING` and `CREATED` events anymore.

With 8.7, the following events are now appended:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `CREATED` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `ASSIGNING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `ASSIGNED` with `assignee` property as provided

#### `ASSIGNING` has become `CLAIMING` for `CLAIM` operation

When claiming a user task, we previously appended the following records of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CLAIM`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

A new `CLAIMING` intent was introduced to distinguish between claiming and regular assigning.
We now append the following records when claiming a user task:

- `CLAIM`
- `CLAIMING`
- `ASSIGNED`

The `ASSIGNING` event is still appended for assigning a user task.
In that case, we append the following records:

- `ASSIGN`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

## Prefix migration

:::warning
It is a requirement that Operate and Tasklist (for example, using `camunda.operate.elasticsearch.indexPrefix`) have
custom prefixes defined and that you are migrated to another prefix.
:::

### Migrating indices

:::warning
Disk usage will massively increase while the migration is ongoing.
Make sure you have at least double of disk space free.
:::

:::note
It is recommended that you first back up the Elasticsearch, and test the `migrate` script in a test environment first
to ensure there are no unexpected issues.
:::

1. Stop the 8.6 cluster while keeping Elasticsearch up
2. In the `camunda/bin` directory there is a `prefix-migration` script that will execute the prefix migration,
   pass the desired prefix using the `CAMUNDA_DATABASE_INDEXPREFIX` environment variable.

```shell
CAMUNDA_DATABASE_INDEXPREFIX=some-prefix ./prefix-migration
```

### Update to 8.7

With the migration finished, There are mandatory configuration changes to be made prior to updating to 8.7.

:::note
Without these configuration changes the update to 8.7 will fail.
:::

Given a new desired prefix of `some-prefix`

- The configured `CAMUNDA_OPERATE_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` must now be `some-prefix`.
- The configured `CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` must now be `some-prefix`.
- The prefix for the [Camunda exporter](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/exporters/camunda-exporter.md) should be configured using `ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDA_ARGS_INDEX_PREFIX` to `some-prefix`.
