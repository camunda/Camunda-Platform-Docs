:::note

Currently, we've add support for the diverging (i.e. splitting, forking) inclusive gateway, not yet add support for the converging (i.e. merging, joining) inclusive gateway. A combination of parallel and exclusive gateways can be used to merge the flows again.

:::

The inclusive gateway (or OR-gateway) allows for making multiple decisions, not just one.

![A process model to prepare lunch at lunchtime can use an inclusive gateway to decide which steps to take to prepare the different lunch components, e.g. cook pasta, stir-fry steak, and/or prepare salad.](assets/inclusive-gateway.png)

If an inclusive gateway has multiple outgoing sequence flows, all sequence flows must have a `conditionExpression` to define when the flow is taken. The gateway can have one sequence flow be defined as the default flow.

When an inclusive gateway is entered, the `conditionExpression` is evaluated. The process instance takes all sequence flows where the condition is fulfilled.

For example: Courses selected include `pasta` and `salad`.

For example: Courses selected include `steak`, `pasta` and `salad`.

If no condition is fulfilled, it takes the **default flow** of the gateway. If the gateway has no default flow, an incident is created.

For example: No courses selected then the default flow `Salad` is taken.

If the inclusive gateway only has one outgoing sequence flow, then it does not need to have a condition.

## Conditions

A `conditionExpression` defines when a flow is taken. It is a [boolean expression](/components/concepts/expressions.md#boolean-expressions) that can access the process instance variables and compare them with literals or other variables. The condition is fulfilled when the expression returns `true`.

Multiple boolean values or comparisons can be combined as disjunction (`and`) or conjunction (`or`).

For example:

```feel
= totalPrice > 100

= order.customer = "Paul"

= orderCount > 15 or totalPrice > 50

= valid and orderCount > 0

= contains(courses, "salad")
```

### XML representation

An inclusive gateway with three outgoing sequence flows and the default sequence flow is `Salad`:

```xml
