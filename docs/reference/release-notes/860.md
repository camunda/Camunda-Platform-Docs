## Enhancements

## 8.6.0-alpha1

### Relative dates in task tiles

Creation, due, and follow-up dates are now shown as relative dates in task tiles (e.g. "Tomorrow" instead of "10 April 2024 - 13:34 PM").

### Extend forms with Javascript

Developers can now add a component to forms to execute JavaScript, e.g. for formatting, complex logic, or calling APIs on their own network. Developers must explicitly assign form variables to the expression and return the results to the form state via a callback function. The component is hidden from rendering.

### Anti CSRF Token for Tasklist

Tasklist sessions are now protected via an anti CSRF token.
