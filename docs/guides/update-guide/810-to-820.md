The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Platform 8.1.x to 8.2.0 for each component of the system.

## Server

### Zeebe

No changes are required to update from 8.1 to 8.2.

The default [backpressure](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/operations/backpressure.md) algorithm is changed from vegas to aimd.
The aimd algorithm is improved in 8.2. This may change the performance characteristics.
