## Changes in supported environments

### Camunda Platform 7

Optimize now requires at least Camunda Platform 7 `7.16.0` and supports up to `7.18.0+`. Camunda Platform 7 `7.15.x` is not supported anymore.
See the [supported environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments/#camunda-platform-7--optimize-version-matrix) sections for the full range of supported versions.

### Elasticsearch

Optimize now requires at least Elasticsearch `7.13.0`.
See the [Supported Environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments) sections for the full range of supported versions.

If you need to update your Elasticsearch cluster, refer to the general [Elasticsearch Update Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html) on how to do that. Usually, the only thing you need to do is perform a [rolling update](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rolling-upgrades.html).
