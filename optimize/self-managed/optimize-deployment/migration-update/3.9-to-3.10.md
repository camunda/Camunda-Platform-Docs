:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 3.10, perform the steps in the [migration and update instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

The update to 3.10.x can be performed from any 3.9.x release.

Here you will find information about:

- Limitations
- Known issues
- Changes in supported environments
- Any unexpected behavior of Optimize (for example, due to a new feature)
- Changes in translation resources

## Changes in the configuration

In the 3.10 version of Optimize, it is no longer possible to apply custom configuration to the UI header. The following
configuration options have therefore been deprecated:

- ui.header.textColor
- ui.header.pathToLogoIcon
- ui.header.backgroundColor
