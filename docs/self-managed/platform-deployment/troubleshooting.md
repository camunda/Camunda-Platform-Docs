## Keycloak requires SSL for requests from external sources

When deploying the Camunda Platform to a provider, it is important to confirm the IP ranges used
for container to container communication align with the IP ranges Keycloak considers "local". By default, Keycloak considers all IPs outside those listed in their
[external requests documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/#_setting_up_ssl)
to be external and therefore require SSL.

As the [Camunda Platform Helm Charts](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm) currently do
not provide support for the distribution of the Keycloak TLS key to the other containers, we recommend viewing the solution available in the
[Identity documentation](/docs/self-managed/identity/troubleshooting/common-problems#solution-2-identity-making-requests-from-an-external-ip-address).

## Identity redirect URL

If HTTP to HTTPS redirection is enabled in the load-balancer or ingress, make sure to use the HTTPS
protocol in the values file under `global.identity.auth.[COMPONENT].redirectUrl`.
Otherwise, you will get a redirection error in Keycloak.

For example:

```
global:
  identity:
    auth:
    operate
      redirectUrl: https://operate.example.com
```
