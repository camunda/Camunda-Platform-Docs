Welcome to the Zeebe Getting Started Tutorial.

We'll walk you through an end-to-end Zeebe example, including building and configuring a workflow model in Zeebe Modeler, deploying the model then creating and working on instances using the Zeebe Command Line Interface, and then seeing what's going on in a tool called Operate.
