# Versioning

Our documentation is versioned. All sections are versioned together, this includes products that do not have a fixed release cycle (such as Console, Web Modeler, and Connectors).

## Structure

### Contents

The `Next` version of the documentation can be found in the folder [docs](../docs). All contents in this folder will be visible by default after a release of the documentation.

Numbered versions can be found in the folder [versioned_docs](../versioned_docs). All subfolders represent a separate version.

### Navigation

The navigation of the documentation is configured via 'sidebars.js'. Again, a distinction is made between the latest and older versions:

- Latest: [sidebars.js](../sidebars.js)
- Versioned: each version under [versioned_sidebars](../versioned_sidebars)

## Create new version

New versions are created as part of the [release process](/howtos/release-procedure.md).

## Further information

The Docusaurus documentation provides a detailed explanation of versioning at [https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/versioning/](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/versioning/).
