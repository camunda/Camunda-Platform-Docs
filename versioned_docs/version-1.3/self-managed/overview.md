:::note

Camunda Cloud Self-Managed is not Camunda Platform. If you are looking for Camunda Platform documentation, [click here](https://docs.camunda.org).

However, Optimize documentation is available for both Camunda Cloud and Camunda Platform, including deployment instructions available [here]($optimize$/self-managed/optimize-deployment/setup/). Look for "Camunda Platform 7" badges to help you understand what content is available for what product.

:::

The alternative way to use Camunda Cloud is to host it yourself through Camunda Cloud Self-Managed.

Building process automation solutions with Camunda Cloud Self-Managed is similar to working with Camunda Cloud SaaS. For more information on Camunda Cloud SaaS, review [What is Camunda Cloud?](../components/concepts/what-is-camunda-cloud.md) If you are new to Camunda Cloud, we recommend you start your journey with [Camunda Cloud SaaS-based guides](../../guides/).

The content in this section of the documentation will include everything you need to download, configure, and work with each component of Camunda Cloud Self-Managed. Features specific to Camunda Cloud Self-Managed will be documented in this section.

The following components are available for Camunda Cloud Self-Managed:

* Zeebe
* Operate
* Tasklist
* Optimize
* IAM (not available in Camunda Cloud SaaS)

Camunda Cloud Self-Managed users may also use Desktop Modeler to build BPMN diagrams and work with Camunda Forms.

While documentation for Optimize is available in the Self-Managed section, we continue to refine the experience for Camunda Cloud Self-Managed users.
