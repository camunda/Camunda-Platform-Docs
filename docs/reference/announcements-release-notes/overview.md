description: "Important announcements and release notes for upcoming and past Camunda 8 releases that customers should be aware of."
---

In this section you will find announcements and release notes for each supported version of the Camunda documentation.

**Announcements** include:

- Versioning changes
- Deprecations or breaking changes
- Known limitations
- Major product/feature releases, labeled as "New features", which may include any product feature impacting several components and could lead to a disruption in users' typical journey through the product, or a breaking change across additional components.

**Release notes** include:

- Notable new and enhanced features. These differ from the major product and feature releases in announcements because they do not impact several components and should not lead to a disruption in users' typical journey through the product.
- Bug fixes

Release notes are separated by minor release pages and include alphas released during the development cycle.
