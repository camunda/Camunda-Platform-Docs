IAM is the component within the Camunda Cloud stack that is responsible for authentication and authorization. It allows you to:
- Manage users
- Manage roles
- Manage permissions

### That's great, but what do I do now?
Well, if you are new to IAM we suggest you head over to the [Step 1: Setup environment](../getting-started/docker/setup-environment/) to get started on your journey!
