Collaboration between business and IT professionals can be challenging, that's why we have introduced two modes in BPMN diagrams, that help users with different technical background to collaborate effectively.

The **design** mode view is tailored to business users, and the **implementation** mode view is tailored to developers.

Business users can now focus on modeling, sharing, and collaborating, while developers can work on implementation with ease.

When accessing a BPMN diagram for the first time, the **design** mode will be the first selected option. Anyway, any further selection will be remembered and kept for the next sessions.

Note: When a process template is selected, the default mode will be the **implement** one.
