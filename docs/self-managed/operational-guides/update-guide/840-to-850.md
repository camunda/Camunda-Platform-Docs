The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.4.x to 8.5.x for each component.

## Zeebe

### Deprecated broker health checks

The broker health check routes have moved, and the old routes are now deprecated. Specifically, the following routes will return [a status code of 301](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301) and redirect you. See the table below about the new mappings:

| Old route                               | **New route**                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/health  | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/status**    |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/ready   | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/readiness** |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/startup | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/startup**   |

Please migrate to the new routes in your deployments. **If you're using the official Helm charts, then you don't have to do anything here.**

### Changes to exported records

The `UserTask` events like `UserTask:CREATED` don't export the string value properties `candidateUsers` and `candidateGroups` anymore.
As a replacement, user task events now feature the string array properties `candidateUsersList` and `candidateGroupsList`.
Custom exporters using these events must be modified accordingly.

:::warning Breaking Change
The values of the `candidateUsers` and `candidateGroups` properties in user task records are lost during an update from `8.4` to `8.5`.
There is no data migration that moves the values from `candidateUsers` and `candidateGroups` to `candidateUsersList` and `candidateGroupsList`
since the Zeebe user tasks are only experimental in `8.4`.

If you need the data on migrated user task instances, you can reactivate them using [Process Instance Modification](/components/concepts/process-instance-modification.md).
This results in a `UserTask:CANCELED` event for the existing user task and a new `UserTask:CREATED` event with the `candidateUsersList` and `candidateGroupsList` filled based on what is configured in the process model.
