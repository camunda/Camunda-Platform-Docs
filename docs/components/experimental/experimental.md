Experimental features are very early-stage ideas and functionalities under exploration. This allows Camunda to innovate quickly and test new concepts.

You can test out these features and provide additional feedback to help Camunda understand how they perform in real-world scenarios.

Note that these features may be unstable, and subject to significant changes or removal. Limitations of experimental features include:

- Not for production use.
- APIs, dependencies, and configurations are likely to change.
- Not always feature-complete.
- Might lack complete documentation.
- No guaranteed updates to newer releases.
- No maintenance service.
- No specific release schedule.
