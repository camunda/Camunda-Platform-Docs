Finding your way around a new tool is sometimes hard. To help with that, we created a **search functionality** that is available in Camunda 8 SaaS under the Console component.

This new search functionality allows users to navigate to:

- Between apps, actions, and tasks (e.g. Go to the modeler, invite users, API clients, etc)
- Camunda project assets (e.g. BPMN, DMN models, clusters by searching for the name)
- All entries in the Camunda forum, documentation, and public GitHub issues

## Opening the search bar

You can open the quick search by pressing `ctrl`+`k` or `⌘`+`k` or by clicking on the magnifier on the top bar

## Pro Search Tips

- Type `>` to execute an action in Console. By using `#` as a prefix you search only in docs.
- Use the keyboard arrows (◀ ▲ ▼ ▶) to navigate through results.
- If you see a ▶ symbol on the right-hand side there is more to see.
- If you want to select a result, just press Enter.
