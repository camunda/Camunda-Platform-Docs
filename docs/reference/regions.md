When you create a cluster in Camunda 8 SaaS, you must specify a region for that cluster.

Currently, we make these regions available for customers on the Trial, Starter, and Enterprise Plans. Enterprise customers can discuss custom regions with their Customer Success Manager.

:::note

- Console and Web Modeler components are currently hosted in the EU. [Contact us](/reference/contact.md) if you have additional questions.
- Running on a Trial or Starter plan and want to try a different region, or interested in other regions or cloud providers? [Contact us](/reference/contact.md) as we are able to make additional regions available on request.
