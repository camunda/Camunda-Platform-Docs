:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 3.8.x, perform the following steps: [Migration & Update Instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

The update to 3.8.x can be performed from any 3.7.x release.

Here you will find information about:

* Limitations
* Known issues
* Changes in the supported environments
* Any unexpected behavior of Optimize (e.g due to a new feature)

## Known issues

No known issues at the moment

## Changes in Supported Environments
### Camunda Platform

Optimize now requires at least Camunda Platform `7.15.0` and supports up to `7.17.0+`. Camunda Platform `7.14.x` is not supported anymore.
See the [Supported Environments](../../../../reference/supported-environments/#camunda-platform-7--optimize-version-matrix) sections for the full range of supported versions.

## New behavior

Due to a general overhaul in the public API, the authentication to all API requests must now be performed via a 
`Bearer Token` in the request header. On previous versions you had two possible ways to authenticate your API requests: 
Either by providing the secret as the query parameter `accessToken` or by providing it in the request header as a 
`Bearer Token`. If you were using the latter method, no change is necessary and your requests will just keep working 
as usual. If you were using the query Parameter method you will need to change your requests. For more information please see [Authorization](../../rest-api/authorization/).

## Changes in translation files

In case you manage your own translations into different languages, you can find a list below with all the changes 
that need to be translated for this release. 

### Localization file
The following terms have been added/removed to/from the localization file (`en.json`) since the last release: 
[Differences Localization](translation-diffs/differences_localization_370_380.diff)

* lines with a `+` in the beginning mark the addition/update of a term, lines with a `-` mark the removal of a term

### Text from "What's new" dialogue
For the purposes of translation, please find the text for the `What's new` dialogue below: 

```
## Set and Track Time-Based Goals

Set data-driven service level agreements (SLAs) on how long all your processes should take so you can quickly identify which processes are underperforming.

## KPI Reports

Create reports and alerts tracking percentages like fully automated instances or incident rate (%), plus SLA statistics on durations like P99 or P95 duration in addition to minimum, median, and maximum.

## Improved UX

Rename variables in plain language, filter out noisy outlier analysis heatmaps, and apply rolling date filters to your dashboards to focus on the most important data.
