| 12 August 2024 | - [ Camunda 8 core ](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/releases/tag/8.6.0-alpha4) <br /> - [ Connectors ](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/releases/tag/8.6.0-alpha4) | [Release blog](https://camunda.com/blog/2024/07/camunda-alpha-release-august-2024/) |

### Using Camunda 8 Connectors in Desktop Modeler

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2253 -->

You can now enable the automatic fetching of Camunda 8 Connector templates in the Desktop Modeler, ensuring you always have the latest templates at your disposal. This feature enhances workflow efficiency and reduces setup time. To enable it, simply set the enable-connector-templates flag as detailed [here](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/use-connectors.md). <!-- Via https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/4053 -->

### Human task orchestration getting started journey

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2395 -->

The Help Center now features a step-by-step guide to complete our [human task orchestration (HTO) tutorial](/guides/getting-started-orchestrate-human-tasks.md), explaining the critical features that every developer interested in HTO needs to know. In addition, users get a glimpse into the user experience for at-scale adoption, and, Enterprise architects get a picture of how Camunda's out-of-the-box Tasklist fits into their architecture.

### AWS Bedrock Connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2404 -->

This new connector allows you to leverage the power of AWS bedrock, the LLM service from amazon. A user can now:

- Make a simple customized request to any models available in the region, leveraging the full power of the `InvokeModel` function from Amazon
- Create a full conversation using the **Converse** method.

### Support `Deployment` version binding for forms, processes, and decisions

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1920 -->

Bundled deployments through process applications or the Camunda API now have version binding. By applying the "deployment" option to a dependent BPMN, DMN, or Form file, you pin the dependency so you can deploy future versions of these files without disrupting ongoing process instances. This feature is ideal for self-contained projects without external or shared dependencies.

### Git sync

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2036 -->

Process applications can now be synchronized with GitHub through a native integration. After an admin approves and configures the basic integration, you can select a path to synchronize with in a GitHub repository. You can pull changes from GitHub to integrate contributions from Desktop Modeler users, make changes, and begin the process to make a pull request so every change is properly reviewed and approved.

Do you use another tool like GitLab or Bitbucket? [Contact us](/contact/) to make your request. Until then, you can use our connectors system and the CI/CD blueprint on the Marketplace.

### Persist data across sessions

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1310 -->

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). Play now supports an end-to-end journey for saving and reusing example data.

- Save example data to the BPMN diagram while playing your process so anyone can use it
- Any user can use this example data in their sessions, eliminating the need for tedious form-fills or copy-pasting
- Connector example data is now available to help define output variables or mock connectors more easily

### OOTB PDLC happy path

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2355 -->

The Web Modeler is building a lightweight, out-of-the box development lifecycle to enable business users to review changes, promote them through changes, and maintain visibility into their journey.

### Console Self-Managed - OIDC support

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2092 -->

By leveraging this API, you can automate various operational management tasks and seamlessly integrate the Camunda platform with your internal tools and systems.

### Enable hourly backup option on Camunda 8 SaaS

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2211 -->

On Camunda 8 SaaS, you can now configure hourly backup intervals if required. Simply head to Console and adjust your backup interval.

### Better visual indication of the executed path in the process

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/274 -->

In Operate, we have improved the visualization of the executed path of a process instance. We highlight both, executed sequence flows and flow nodes, and provide you the option to display how often each flow node was executed.

### Process development lifecycle (PDLC) blueprint

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2014 -->

Developing and releasing Camunda processes in compliance with your organization's policies often creates a long-running, sometimes complex process across many endpoints - a great use case for an orchestrator like Camunda. Camunda is taking the first steps to orchestrate the development lifecycle using its own engine, relevant Connectors, and a [customizable blueprint](https://marketplace.camunda.com/en-US/apps/439170/cicd-pipeline) that you can modify to fit your needs.

### Process application MVP (SaaS only)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1983 -->

The [process application](/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-applications.md) is a special type of folder in Web Modeler that enables bulk actions like deploying all assets together. This reduces the risk of having a broken deployment at runtime and makes it more convenient to deploy related files.

### Instance modification as batch

<!-- Link to main page in https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3747 -->

With the new release operating mass incidents is easier with [batch instance modification](/components/operate/userguide/process-instance-batch-modification.md). If there was an issue in process execution that caused you to enter the wrong process branch or data was corrupted, you can select multiple process instances and move them to the correct place in the process.

### Relative dates in task tiles

<!-- No docs available -->

Creation, due, and follow-up dates are now shown as relative dates in task tiles (e.g. "Tomorrow" instead of "10 April 2024 - 13:34 PM").

### Anti CSRF token for Tasklist

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3672 -->

Tasklist sessions are now protected via an [anti CSRF token](/self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-configuration.md#cross-site-request-forgery-protection).
