## Milestones

You can save a snapshot of your diagram as a milestone at any point in time.
If you make any mistakes while modeling, you can always go back to previously saved snapshots.
You can also easily identify and compare the differences between two milestones.

Find your milestones under the clock icon button

### Creating Milestones
In the milestone history view, the latest version can be saved as a new milestone.

Alternatively, you can create a new milestone via the breadcrumb menu in the diagram view.

When dragging and dropping a file into the diagram view, or when you use the replace via upload option under the breadcrumb menu, a new milestone is created automatically.

### Restoring Milestones

Hover over a milestone, click on the three dots menu and expand for more options.

### Comparing Milestones
Milestones can be compared visually. By enabling the diffing feature, the currently selected milestone will be compared to its predecessor.

The differences that are highlighted are only those that affect the execution of the BPMN process. Pure visual changes like position changes are not highlighted.
