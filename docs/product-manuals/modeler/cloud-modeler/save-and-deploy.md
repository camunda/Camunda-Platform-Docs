title: Save and deploy your diagram
---

Your BPMN diagram can be saved in your organizational context at any time.

You must differentiate between saving and deploying. If a diagram is only saved, it has no effect on your cluster(s). It can be used by all members of your organization.

When you deploy the diagram, it becomes available on the selected cluster and new instances can start.

To save and deploy, follow the steps below:

1. Click **Save and Deploy** in the **Execute** menu to deploy your diagram. If no cluster is available, create a new cluster.

2. After you create a cluster, ensure it is ready to deploy the diagram.

3. Once the cluster is **Healthy**, you can deploy.
