description: "Let's take a closer look at how Operate authenticates for use."
---

Operate provides three ways to authenticate:

1. User information stored in [Elasticsearch](#user-in-elasticsearch).
2. [Camunda Cloud single sign-on](#camunda-cloud-single-sign-on).
3. [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](#ldap).
4. [IAM Authentication and Authorization](#iam)

By default, user storage in Elasticsearch is enabled.

## User in Elasticsearch

In this mode, the user authenticates with a username and password stored in Elasticsearch.

The **Userid** , **displayName**, **password**, and **roles** for one user may be set in `application.yml`:

```
camunda.operate:
  userId: anUserId
  displayName: nameShownInWebpage
  password: aPassword
  roles:
    - OWNER
    - USER
```

Currently, only `OWNER` and/or `USER` roles are available.

### Roles for users
Name | Description 
-----|-------------
OWNER| Full access 
USER | Read only access

On startup of Operate, the user is created if they did not exist before.

By default, two users are created:
* Role `OWNER` with **userId**/**displayName**/**password** `demo`/`demo`/`demo`.
* Role `USER` with **userId**/**displayName**/**password** `view`/`view`/`view`.

Add more users directly to Elasticsearch via the index `operate-user-<version>_`. The password must be encoded with a strong `bcrypt` hashing function.


## LDAP

### Enable LDAP

LDAP can only be enabled by setting the [Spring profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles): `ldap-auth`.

See the following example for setting the Spring profile as an environmental variable:

```
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=ldap-auth
```

### Configuration of LDAP

A user can authenticate via LDAP.

The following parameters for connection to an LDAP server should be given:

 Parameter name | Description | Example | Required
 --------------|------------|---------|--------
 camunda.operate.ldap.url | URL to an LDAP Server | ldaps://camunda.com/ | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.baseDn| Base domain name | dc=camunda,dc=com| Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.managerDn| Manager domain used by Operate to log into LDAP server to retrieve user information | cn=admin,dc=camunda,dc=com| Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.managerPassword| Password for manager| | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.userSearchFilter| Filter to retrieve user info. The pattern '{0}' is replaced by the given username in the login form. | {0} | No, default is {0}
 camunda.operate.ldap.userSearchBase| Starting point for search | ou=Support,dc=camunda,dc=com | No

### Configuration of active directory-based LDAP

For an **active directory**-based LDAP server, the following parameters should be given:

:::note
The active directory configuration will only be applied when `camunda.operate.ldap.domain` is given.
:::

 Parameter name | Description | Required |
 --------------|------------|---------
 camunda.operate.ldap.url | URL to an active directory LDAP server | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.domain| Domain | Yes
 camunda.operate.ldap.baseDn| Root domain name | No
 camunda.operate.ldap.userSearchFilter| Used as a search filter | No

## IAM

[IAM](../../iam/what-is-iam/) provides authentication and authorization functionality along with user management.

### Enable IAM

IAM can only be enabled by setting the [Spring profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles): `iam-auth`.

See the following example:

```
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=iam-auth
```

### Configure IAM
IAM requires the following parameters:

Parameter name | Description | Example value
---------------|-------------|---------------
camunda.operate.iam.issuer | Name/ID of issuer | http://app.iam.localhost
camunda.operate.iam.issuerUrl | Url of issuer (IAM) | http://app.iam.localhost
camunda.operate.iam.clientId | Similar to a username for the application | operate
camunda.operate.iam.clientSecret | Similar to a password for the application. | XALaRPl...s7dL7

We provide two different permissions over IAM: read or write.
To configure the authorization, you are required to create two different permissions:

Permission value | Description 
----------------|-------------
`read:*` | Grants the user the permission to access, view, and read the data in the application.
`write:*` | Grants the user the permission to perform operations.

Note that the minimum permission needed is `read:*`. Any user without this permission will have access denied to the application.
