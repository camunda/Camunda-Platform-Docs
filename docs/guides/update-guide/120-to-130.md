The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Cloud 1.2.x to 1.3.0 for each component of the system.

## Server

### Operate

With Operate 1.3, a new feature was introduced to propagate incidents from called instances to calling instances. 
This feature is only available for instances started after the version 1.3 update. Older instances will still be shown as active
even though incidents in called instances may exist.

### Tasklist

Because of internal changes in user data processing update to Tasklist 1.3 will erase all information about task assignments.
End users would need to claim their tasks again.
