### Export activity logs in Console <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span>

You can export activity logs from Console using either the UI or the API.

For example, on the the **Activity** tab in Organization management, click **Export activity**. You can export and download the activity list as a JSON or CSV file.

### Unified deployment experience from Web Modeler

Web Modeler Self-Managed users now benefit from a simple, secure way to deploy to clusters. During installation, configure the clusters that Web Modeler can deploy to and set the permissions for deployment in the Identity of each cluster. Cluster connection information is preconfigured within the Web Modeler so users can select which cluster to deploy to. In addition, the Web Modeler checks the Identity instance of these connected clusters to see whether the current user is authorized to deploy to that cluster and tenant. For teams using process applications, this process is further simplified, as users simply decide to deploy to `dev`, `test`, or another preauthorized stage.

### Activity log information in Console <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2528 -->

In the Console activity logs you can now see information about changes made to secrets (add, update, remove), and user removals from Console (users unregistered from the organization).

### Email Connector <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Connectors">Connectors</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2430 -->

The Email Connector allows you to integrate your BPMN service with any email server using POP3, IMAP, or SMTP. This new Connector enables you to automate the retrieval, deletion, search, and organization of emails directly within your processes.

To learn more about this Connector, see [Email Connector](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/email.md).

### Generate Connector templates (OpenAPI + Postman) <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Connectors">Connectors</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2049 -->

You can now configure and automatically generate a custom Connector template in Web Modeler. This feature simplifies creating consistent, deployable templates, making Connector setup quicker and more flexible.

- You can start from a blank template or import an existing API definition such as an OpenAPI specification, Swagger specification, or a Postman collection.
- For example, download a Postman collection as a YAML file, import this into the generator, and choose which methods to include in the generated template.

To learn more about generating Connector templates, see [generate a Connector template](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-template-generator.md).

### Monorepo Git sync <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Modeler">Modeler</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2503 -->

When configuring Git sync in Web Modeler, define the optional `/path` option to unlock new use cases.

- This option allows you to specify the path to the folder containing your process application files.
- Sync with your main branch to perform visual diffing, collaboration, and manual testing in Web Modeler. Remember not to make any changes in this branch.
- Vary the `/path` for multiple process applications to integrate Web Modeler with your existing monorepo containing all your code assets.

To learn more about configuring Git sync, see [Git sync](/components/modeler/web-modeler/git-sync.md).

### Resize clusters on SaaS <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2515 -->

Enterprise customers can flexibly resize their clusters to adjust capacity and performance.

- Increase or decrease the cluster size at any time by adding or removing hosting packages.
- For example, increase the cluster size to improve performance and add capacity, or decrease the cluster size to free up reservations for another cluster.

To learn more about this feature, see [resize a cluster](/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-cluster.md#resize-a-cluster).

### Unified deployment experience for Web Modeler <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Modeler">Modeler</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2073 -->

#### Deployment stages

Predefined deployment stages for process applications are now also available in Web Modeler Self-Managed.

- Select your dev, test, stage, and prod clusters to ensure process applications flow easily and predictably through your deployment pipeline.
- For added control, do not assign a stage or prod environment to enable rapid iteration in Web Modeler while still ensuring deployments run through your approved pipeline.

#### Simplified deployment

The deployment experience for Enterprise customers running Web Modeler Self-Managed is simplified.

- During Camunda installation, you can configure your Helm chart to decide which clusters are available from Web Modeler by default, and save their connection information.
- With this setup, you only need to select a cluster, and add secrets and a tenant ID as required.
