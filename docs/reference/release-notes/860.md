- This feature is ideal for self-contained projects without external or shared dependencies.

### Git sync

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2036 -->

You can now synchronize process applications with GitHub using a native integration.

- After an admin approves and configures the basic integration, you can select a path to synchronize with in a GitHub repository.
- You can pull changes from GitHub to integrate contributions from Desktop Modeler users, make changes, and begin the process to make a pull request so every change is properly reviewed and approved.

Do you use another tool such as GitLab or Bitbucket? [Contact us](/contact/) to make your request. Until then, you can use our Connectors system and the CI/CD blueprint on the Marketplace.

### Persist data across sessions

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1310 -->

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). Play now supports an end-to-end journey for saving and reusing example data.

- Save example data to the BPMN diagram while playing your process so anyone can use it.
- Any user can use this example data in their sessions, eliminating the need for tedious form-fills or copy-pasting.
- Connector example data is now available to help define output variables or mock Connectors.

### Process development lifecycle (PDLC) blueprint

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2014 -->

Developing and releasing Camunda processes in compliance with your organization's policies often creates a long-running, sometimes complex process across many endpoints - a great use case for an orchestrator like Camunda. Camunda is taking the first steps to orchestrate the development lifecycle using its own engine, relevant Connectors, and a [customizable blueprint](https://marketplace.camunda.com/en-US/apps/439170/cicd-pipeline) that you can modify to fit your needs.

### Process application MVP (SaaS only)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1983 -->

The [process application](/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-applications.md) is a special type of folder in Web Modeler that enables bulk actions like deploying all assets together. This reduces the risk of having a broken deployment at runtime and makes it more convenient to deploy related files.

### Instance modification as batch

<!-- Link to main page in https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3747 -->

With the new release operating mass incidents is easier with [batch instance modification](/components/operate/userguide/process-instance-batch-modification.md). If there was an issue in process execution that caused you to enter the wrong process branch or data was corrupted, you can select multiple process instances and move them to the correct place in the process.

### Relative dates in task tiles

<!-- No docs available -->

Creation, due, and follow-up dates are now shown as relative dates in task tiles (e.g. "Tomorrow" instead of "10 April 2024 - 13:34 PM").

### Anti CSRF token for Tasklist

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3672 -->

Tasklist sessions are now protected via an [anti CSRF token](/self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-configuration.md#cross-site-request-forgery-protection).
