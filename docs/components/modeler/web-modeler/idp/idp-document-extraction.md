Use a document extraction project to identify and extract specific pieces of data from your structured and unstructured documents.

## About document extraction

Document extraction projects form the basis for using IDP in your end-to-end processes.

Create a separate document extraction project for each type of document you want to categorize and extract data from, such as an invoice, a report, identity document, and so on.
