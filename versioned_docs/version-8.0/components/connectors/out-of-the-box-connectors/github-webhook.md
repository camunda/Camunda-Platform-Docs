The **GitHub Webhook Connector** is an inbound Connector that allows you to start a BPMN process instance triggered by a [GitHub event](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks).

To use **GitHub Webhook Connector**, you need to have the [Zeebe](/docs/components/zeebe/zeebe-overview.md) version 8.1 higher. Once you have the updated version, you can explore the [GitHub Webhook documentation](/docs/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/github-webhook.md) for detailed information on configuring and using this connector. Additionally, refer to the [update guide documentation](/docs/guides/update-guide/introduction.md) provided to ensure you have the latest version of the Camunda Platform.
