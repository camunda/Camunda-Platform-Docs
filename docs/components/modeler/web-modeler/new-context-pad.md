:::note
The new context pad is an alpha feature. Since it has a significant impact on the user experience it's not enabled by default for enterprise customers. It can be enabled through the [alpha features](/components/console/manage-organization/enable-alpha-features.md) menu.

The context pad is one of the main ways to interact with the diagram. Therefore, an intuitive and easy-to-use context pad is crucial for a good user experience. The new context pad is designed to be more intuitive and easier to use than the old context pad. Actions that change the selected element are now separated from actions that add elements to the diagram. This makes it easier to find the action you are looking for.

The new append feature is separated from the context pad and allows you to append any element directly without having to change the type of the element you just appended.
