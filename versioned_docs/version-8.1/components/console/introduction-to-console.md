Camunda Console is the management application for the included products.

Using Camunda Console, you can do the following:

- [Create](./manage-clusters/create-cluster.md) and [delete](./manage-clusters/delete-cluster.md) clusters.
- [Manage API clients](./manage-clusters/manage-api-clients.md) to interact with [Zeebe](/components/zeebe/zeebe-overview.md) and [Tasklist](/components/tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist.md).
- [Manage alerts](./manage-clusters/manage-alerts.md) to get notified when workflow errors occur.
- [Manage IP Whitelists](./manage-clusters/manage-ip-whitelists.md) to restrict access to clusters.
- [Manage](./manage-organization/organization-settings.md) your organization.
- [Administration API clients (REST)](/apis-tools/administration-api-reference.md) to manage clusters programmatically.
