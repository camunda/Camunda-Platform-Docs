The **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) inbound Connector** is a Connector that allows you to start or continue
a BPMN process triggered by an [Amazon SNS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home) notification.

## Create an Amazon SNS inbound Connector task

1. Start building your BPMN diagram. You can use the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** with either a **Start Event** or **Intermediate Catch Event**.
2. Select the applicable element and change its template to an **Amazon SNS connector**.
3. Fill in all required properties.
4. Complete your BPMN diagram.
5. Deploy the diagram to activate the webhook.
6. Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab in the properties panel to see the webhook URL.

## Make your Amazon SNS inbound Connector for receiving notifications executable

1. In the **Subscription Configuration** section, configure the **Subscription ID**. By default, **Subscription ID** is pre-filled with a random value. This value will be a part of the topic subscription URL.
2. Set the **Allow to receive messages from topic(s)** value to **any** if the process may be triggered by any topic, or **Specific topic(s)** if you wish to allow-list only certain topics to start a new BPMN process.
3. If you have chosen the **Specific topic(s)**, you have to list comma-separated topics in the field **Topic ARN(s)** as well. In that case, the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** will auto-approve each qualified subscription request.
4. In the section **Activation**, configure **Condition** when the Amazon SNS topic can trigger a new BPMN process. The following example will trigger a new BPMN process for every notification with a subject _Start BPMN_: `=(request.body.Subject = "Start BPMN")`.
5. In the section **Variable mapping** fill the field **Result variable** to store the response in a process variable. For example, `myResultVariable`.
6. In the section **Variable expression** fill the field to map specific fields from the response into process variables using [FEEL](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md).
   The following example will extract both message and subject from Amazon SNS message: `={message: request.body.Message, subject: request.body.Subject}`.

When using the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** with an **Intermediate Catch Event**, fill in the **Correlation key (process)** and **Correlation key (payload)**.

- **Correlation key (process)** is a FEEL expression that defines the correlation key for the subscription. This corresponds to the **Correlation key** property of a regular **Message Intermediate Catch Event**.
- **Correlation key (payload)** is a FEEL expression used to extract the correlation key from the incoming message. This expression is evaluated in the Connector Runtime and the result is used to correlate the message.

For example, given that your correlation key is defined with `myCorrelationKey` process variable, and the request body contains `"MessageAttributes": {"attrName1" : {"Type":"String","Value":"attrVal"}}`, your correlation key settings will look like this:

- **Correlation key (process)**: `=myCorrelationKey`
- **Correlation key (payload)**: `=request.body.MessageAttributes.attrName1.Value`

Learn more about correlation keys in the [messages guide](../../../concepts/messages).

## Activate the Amazon SNS inbound Connector by deploying your diagram

Once you click the **Deploy** button, your **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** will be activated and publicly available.

URLs of the exposed **Amazon SNS Inbound Connector** adhere to the following pattern:

`https://<base URL>/inbound/<subscription ID>`

- `<base URL>` is the URL of Connectors component deployment. When using the Camunda 8 SaaS offering, this will typically contain your cluster region and cluster ID.
- `<subscription ID>` is the ID (path) you configured in the properties of your **Amazon SNS inbound Connector**.

If you make changes to your **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** configuration, you need to redeploy the BPMN diagram for the changes to take effect.

When you click on the event with **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** applied to it, a new **Webhooks** tab will appear in the properties panel.
This tab displays the URL of the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** for every cluster where you have deployed your BPMN diagram.

:::note
The **Webhooks** tab is only supported in Web Modeler as part of the Camunda 8 SaaS offering.
You can still use Amazon SNS inbound Connectors in Desktop Modeler, or with Camunda 8 Self-Managed.
In that case, Amazon SNS inbound Connector deployments and URLs will not be displayed in Modeler.

## Wiring with Amazon SNS

1. Sign in to the [Amazon SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home).
2. On the navigation panel, choose **Topics**.
3. Choose the **Create** subscription.
4. In the **Protocol** drop-down list, select **HTTPS**.
5. In the **Endpoint** box, paste in the URL of the subscription found in at the **Webhooks** tab of your BPMN
   diagram that you want the topic to send messages. Then, choose **Create subscription**.
6. The confirmation message is displayed. Choose **Close**. Your new subscription's **Subscription ID**
   displays **PendingConfirmation**. Shortly after it will be confirmed by the BPMN process assuming **Allow to receive messages from topic(s)** contains the SNS topic ARN.

## Security considerations

### Access control

The field **Allow to receive messages from topic(s)** and related **Topic ARN(s)** allows you to control which Amazon SNS topics can trigger a BPMN process.
You can also achieve the same outcome by specifying **Condition** in the **Activation** section. For example, given **Topic ARN(s)** equals `arn:aws:sns:eu-central-1:1234567890:SNSWebhook`,
is the same as **Condition** equals `=(request.body.TopicArn = "arn:aws:sns:eu-central-1:1234567890:SNSWebhook")`.

### Integrity

Each Amazon SNS message is digitally signed with an AWS private key. The body of a message contains a digital signature of
the entire content. The **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Inbound Connector** verifies every message against
the Amazon SNS public certificate to ensure the message is of known origin and has not been tampered with.
