title: "Camunda 8 Self-Managed"
---

<!--- I'm going to create an issue in my backlog to gut this page. It isn't in bad shape, but I'd love to spend as much time on it as I did the SaaS components overview. Instead of just listing what is available, I'll add some descriptions for this and such.

I think this also warrants discussion about merging this with the Architecture doc below this in the sidebar. To discuss with engineering.

However, I do know you have also been working with Immi on this section.

My biggest complaint is this page almost references C8 SaaS and C7 more often than C8 SM to clarify differences (which is perhaps our largest priority), but I'd like to see more details on WHAT SM is and WHY a user might prefer it here.--->

:::note

Camunda 8 Self-Managed is not Camunda 7. [Find Camunda 7 documentation here](https://docs.camunda.org).

However, Optimize documentation is available for both Camunda 8 and Camunda 7, including deployment instructions available [here]($optimize$/self-managed/optimize-deployment/install-and-start). Look for `Camunda 7` badges to help you understand what content is available for what product. While documentation for Optimize is available in the Self-Managed section, we continue to refine the experience for Camunda 8 Self-Managed users.

:::

As an alternative to using Camunda 8 through SaaS, you can host it yourself; we call this setup Camunda 8 Self-Managed.

Building process automation solutions with Camunda 8 Self-Managed is similar to working with Camunda 8 SaaS. For more information on Camunda 8 SaaS, check out [What is Camunda 8?](../components/concepts/what-is-camunda-8.md) If you are new to Camunda 8, we recommend you start your journey with [Camunda 8 SaaS-based guides](../../guides/).

The content in this section of the documentation includes:

- Everything you need to download, configure, and work with each component of Camunda 8 Self-Managed.
- Features specific to Camunda 8 Self-Managed.

The following components are available for Camunda 8 Self-Managed:

- Zeebe
- Zeebe Gateway
- Operate
- Tasklist
- Connectors
- Optimize
- Identity (not available in Camunda 8 SaaS)
- Web Modeler [<span class="badge badge--enterprise-only">Enterprise only</span>](../../reference/licenses/#web-modeler)

Camunda 8 Self-Managed users may also use [Desktop Modeler](../../components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler) as an addition to these components. Desktop Modeler can be used by process developers to build BPMN diagrams, DMN diagrams, or [Camunda Forms](../guides/utilizing-forms.md) for automation.
