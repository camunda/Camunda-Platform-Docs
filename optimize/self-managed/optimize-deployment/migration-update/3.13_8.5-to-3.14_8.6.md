:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 8.6/3.14, perform the steps in the [migration and update instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

The update to 8.6/3.14 can be performed from any 8.5/3.13 release.

Here you will find information about:

- Limitations
- Known issues
- Changes in supported environments
- Changes in behavior (for example, due to a new feature)
- Changes in translation resources

## Changes in behavior

### Telemetry

Optimize no longer gathers telemetry data, and this is removed from the UI and Elasticsearch. The associated key in the configuration file (`telemetry.telemetryEndpoint`) was removed.

## Changes in supported environments

### Camunda 7

Optimize now requires at least Camunda 7 `7.20.0` and supports up to `7.22.0+`. Camunda 7 `7.19.x` is no longer supported.

### Java

Optimize now supports Java 21+.

### Elasticsearch

Optimize now supports Elasticsearch 8.13.0+.

See the [supported environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments/#component-requirements) documentation for the full range of supported versions.

#### Docker tag naming convention

The Docker tag naming conventions have been updated:

- For Camunda 8, the Optimize Docker tag `latest` has been changed to `8-latest`.
- For Camunda 7, Optimize continues to use the `latest` tag.
