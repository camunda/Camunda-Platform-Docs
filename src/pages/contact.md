# Contact

There are various channels where you can reach us.

- We encourage everyone to participate in our **community** via the [Camunda Cloud community forum](https://forum.camunda.io/) or [Slack](https://camunda-cloud.slack.com/), where you can exchange ideas with other Zeebe and Camunda Cloud users, as well as the product developers. If you are joining our Slack for the first time, you will need to get an [invite](https://zeebe-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) first.

- If you find a **bug**, open an issue in this [repository](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/issues). The bugs have a default template, so please describe what doesn't work in detail.

- We also accept **feature requests** through a similar process. Please open an issue in this [repository](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/issues). The feature requests have a default template, so describe what you'd like to see in detail.

- For **security-related issues**, review our [Security notices](../../docs/reference/notices) for the most up-to-date information on known issues and steps to report a vulnerability so we can solve the problem as quickly as possible. Do not use GitHub for security-related issues.

- **Feedback and Support** can be submitted or requested via JIRA for subscription or enterprise customers in the Support project. Otherwise, use the [Camunda Cloud community forum](https://forum.camunda.io/).
