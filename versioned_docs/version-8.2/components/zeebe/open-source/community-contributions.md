Zeebe is available as open source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe).

Zeebe welcomes extensions and contributions from the community!

We use both the [Camunda Community Hub](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/) and [Awesome Camunda Platform 8](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/awesome-camunda-platform-8) to keep track of Zeebe ecosystem contributions, including the following:

- Clients
- Workers
- Exporters
- Applications
- Other integrations such as Spring-Zeebe and the Apache Kafka Connector

If you have built something for the Zeebe ecosystem, we encourage you to [transfer it to the Camunda Community Hub](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/main/transferring-extensions.md).

If you're interested in contributing to the main Zeebe repository (versus creating an extension that lives in its own repository), be sure to start with the [Contributing to Zeebe](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide in GitHub.
