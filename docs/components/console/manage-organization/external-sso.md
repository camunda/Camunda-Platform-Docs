## Connecting your Identity Provider with Camunda Platform

For Enterprise customers we support integrating external Identity Providers so users within your organization do not need to signup and by that creating an account with us.

We currently support both SAML and AzureAD. As this requires changes in our environment, please raise a Support Ticket in the [support queue](https://jira.camunda.com/projects/SUPPORT/).
