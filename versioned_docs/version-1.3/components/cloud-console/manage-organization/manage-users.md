## General rights concept

When a user signs up for Camunda Cloud, they receive a personal organization. Clusters the user creates in this organization are assigned to this organization.

If several users need access to the same Zeebe cluster, all users can be assigned to the same organization.

## Users

Under this setting, members of the current organization can be managed. A user can have one of the following roles:

- **Owner**: Owner of the organization (currently limited to one user and cannot be changed by the user.)
- **Admin**: Restricted rights for user management.
- **Member**: Can manage Zeebe clusters, client, and use [Operate](/components/operate/index.md).

The following table illustrates the rights of each role:

|                              | Owner | Admin | Member |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Manage Zeebe clusters        | X     | X     | X      |
| Manage clients               | X     | X     | X      |
| Use Operate                  | X     | X     | X      |
| Users: Manage members        | X     | X     |        |
| Billing: Manage reservations | X     | X     |        |
| Billing: Request paid plan   | X     | X     |        |
| Users: Manage admins         | X     |       |        |

Users are invited to a Camunda Cloud organization via their email address, which must be accepted by the user. The user remains in the `Pending` state until the invitation is accepted.

People who do not yet have a Camunda Cloud account can also be invited to an organization. To access the organization, however, the invited individual must first [create a Camunda Cloud account](../../../guides/getting-started/create-camunda-cloud-account.md).
