**Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL)** is designed to write expressions in a way that is easily understood by both business professionals and developers. In Camunda, FEEL is used to define expressions in the context of both [BPMN](/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn.md) and [DMN](/docs/components/modeler/dmn/dmn.md) diagrams. FEEL is specified in
the [DMN specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/) of the Object Management Group (OMG).

## Learning FEEL

To understand FEEL better and how it is integrated into Camunda, you can explore the following resources:

- [Expressions in Camunda 8](/docs/components/concepts/expressions.md): Learn how expressions are used within our platform.
- [FEEL syntax and operators](./language-guide/feel-expressions-introduction.md): Learn how to write basic expression.
- [Built-in functions](./builtin-functions/feel-built-in-functions-introduction.md): Read about functions the FEEL engine offers.

## FEEL engines

To evaluate your expressions, Camunda employs two distinct FEEL engines depending on the use-case: FEEL Scala (the Java FEEL engine) and feelin (the JavaScript FEEL engine). While both support the basic FEEL syntax and functions, certain extensions are only available in FEEL Scala. You can try out your expressions in our playgrounds outlined below.

### FEEL Scala (Java FEEL engine)

<MarkerCamundaExtension />

[**FEEL Scala**](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala) is a Java-based FEEL engine integrated into the backend of our platform. It is primarily responsible for evaluating expressions in BPMN diagrams and DMN tables. Functions marked as "Camunda Extension" are not part of the FEEL specification and are only supported by FEEL Scala.

Try out expressions in the [FEEL Scala Playground](https://camunda.github.io/feel-scala/docs/playground/).

### feelin (JavaScript FEEL engine)

[**feelin**](https://github.com/nikku/feelin) is a JavaScript-based FEEL engine designed for use in the browser is used for [Camunda Forms](../forms/camunda-forms-reference.md) and [templating](../forms/configuration/forms-config-templating-syntax.md). Functions marked as "Camunda Extension" are **not** supported by feelin.

Try out expressions in the [feelin Playground](https://nikku.github.io/feel-playground/).
