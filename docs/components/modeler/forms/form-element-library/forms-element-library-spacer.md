A Spacer component used to create a defined amount of vertical space between two elements.

### Configurable properties

- **Height**: Defines the vertical space the Spacer takes up. Defined as a number of pixels.

### Usage

The Spacer is generally used in scenarios where you need to add separation between elements in the layout. For instance, you might use a Spacer to separate two blocks of form fields, to create a gap between a heading and the subsequent content, or to prevent different sections of the page from visually merging together.

Using the Spacer judiciously can help create cleaner, more readable layouts, especially in complex forms or pages with many different sections.
