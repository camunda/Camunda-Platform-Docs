If a BPMN diagram is deployed via Cloud Modeler, you can start a new instance of this diagram.

To do so, click **Start Instance** in the context menu.

You can also specify variables written to the process context at startup. The variables must be formatted in valid JSON. As an example, you can use the following JSON:

```json
{
  "hello": "world"
}
```
