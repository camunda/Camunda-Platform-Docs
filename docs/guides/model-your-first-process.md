## Design and deploy a process

In Camunda Platform 8, you have two options to design and deploy a process, but for the purposes for this guide you will find instructions for Web Modeler.

1. To create a BPMN diagram, navigate to Web Modeler via the **Modeler** tab, and click **New project**.
2. Name your project and select **New > BPMN Diagram > + Create blank**.
3. Give your model a descriptive name, and then give your model a descriptive id within the **General** tab inside the properties panel on the right side of the screen.



4. No need to save. Web Modeler will autosave every change you make.
