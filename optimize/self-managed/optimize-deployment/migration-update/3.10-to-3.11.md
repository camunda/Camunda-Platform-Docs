:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 3.11, perform the steps in the [migration and update instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

The update to 3.11 can be performed from any 3.10.x release.

Here you will find information about:

- Limitations
- Known issues
- Changes in supported environments
- Any unexpected behavior of Optimize (for example, due to a new feature)
- Changes in translation resources

## Elasticsearch

Optimize now supports Elasticsearch `8.7`.
See the [supported environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments) section for the full range of supported versions.

If you need to update your Elasticsearch cluster, refer to the general [Elasticsearch update guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html). Usually, the only thing you need to do is perform a [rolling update](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rolling-upgrades.html).

## Changes in the configuration

Prior to Optimize 3.11.0, Optimize has performed collection role cleanup after syncing identities with the engine. From
Optimize 3.11.0 onwards, this is now disabled by default. It can be reenabled by setting the
`import.identitySync.collectionRoleCleanupEnabled` property value to `true`
