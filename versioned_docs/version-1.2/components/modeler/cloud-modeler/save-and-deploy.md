title: Save and deploy your diagram
---

You must differentiate between saving and deploying. If a diagram is only saved, it has no effect on your cluster(s). It can be used by all members of your organization.

When you deploy the diagram, it becomes available on the selected cluster and new instances can start.

To save and deploy, click **Save and Deploy** in the **Execute** menu:
