## Zeebe

The Camunda Platform is not compatible with the ElasticSearch 8 Curator. This Curator is used to manage data retention
within ElasticSearch. In order to upgrade to ElasticSearch 8 the Curator must be replaced with
[Index Lifecycle Management](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html)
(ILM). Once the upgrade to ElasticSearch 8 is completed the Curator can be disabled.

Details on how to configure ILM for Zeebe can be found on the
[ElasticSearch Exporter](../../../../self-managed/zeebe-deployment/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter#retention) page.

:::note
The ElasticSearch Curator can be replaced with ILM when using ElasticSearch 7 as well. This is useful when incrementally
upgrading from ElasticSearch 7 to 8.
