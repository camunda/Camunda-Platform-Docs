# How to use the docs

[docs.camunda.io](https://docs.camunda.io) is home to the Camunda Platform 8 docs, including all of the components.

Whether you are reading the docs to understand how Camunda Platform 8 works, or helping write the docs, this _meta_ page will give you all the information you need to be successful.

## Structure

Camunda Platform 8 docs are structured in such a way that the documentation is SaaS-first, meaning you will be introduced to the following based on how they are used in Camunda Platform 8 SaaS:

- Guides: Step-by-step material to get started with Camunda Platform 8.
- Components: Product manual and conceptual content for each component in Camunda Platform 8, including Console, Modeler, Zeebe, Operate, Optimize, and Tasklist. Here, you'll also find The Camunda Best Practices section. This section is our condensed experience of using BPMN and DMN on the Camunda toolstack, and is collected by consulting engagement with our customers and feedback from the community.
- APIs & clients: A section dedicated to a variety of offered APIs and clients for integration.
- Reference: General reference material for Camunda Platform 8, including a glossary, supported environments, and dependencies.

### Self-Managed section

Keen eyes may notice the Self-Managed section in the top navigation or the icon on the main page looks a little different than the rest of the sections. This is intentional to help distinguish this area in the docs from SaaS-focused content.

In the Self-Managed section, documentation includes guidance specifically for Self-Managed users that may not apply to SaaS users, including deployment guides for current components of Camunda Platform 8.

In addition, you can find Optimize documentation for Camunda Platform 7 in this section.

## Badges

As the product matures, the documentation will grow. We are experimenting with added visuals near the top of the docs to help you understand the expectations for a given piece of content. For example, how long will it take to read and complete the tasks in the doc? Is this particular document targeted toward beginners versus advanced users? Is this document exclusive to Camunda Platform 7 or Camunda Platform 8 users?

### Difficulty badges

Our getting started guides are for beginners and always will be. However, not all of our guides will be getting started guides! Look for these labels to help you understand what's the best guide for your level.

<span class="badge badge--beginner">Beginner</span>

`<span class="badge badge--beginner">Beginner</span>`

<span class="badge badge--intermediate">Intermediate</span>

`<span class="badge badge--intermediate">Intermediate</span>`

<span class="badge badge--advanced">Advanced</span>

`<span class="badge badge--advanced">Advanced</span>`

### Time estimate badges

We use a mix of word count and reading estimates mixed with hands-on experience to determine our estimations.

<span class="badge badge--short">Time estimate: 5 minutes</span>

`<span class="badge badge--short">Time estimate: 5 minutes</span>`

<span class="badge badge--medium">Time estimate: 20 minutes</span>

`<span class="badge badge--medium">Time estimate: 20 minutes</span>`

<span class="badge badge--long">Time estimate: 1 hour</span>

`<span class="badge badge--long">Time estimate: 1 hour</span>`

### Product or component specific badges

Shipping incrementally means we may not always be at feature parity between Camunda Platform 8 and Camunda Platform 7 or Desktop Modeler and Web Modeler.

In those instances, big or small, we want to make sure you can see what works with each product or component.

<span class="badge badge--platform">Camunda Platform 7 only</span>
