## 8.7.0-alpha1

### Template Generator UI Integration (OpenAPI + Postman)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2049 -->

### Email Connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2430 -->

The Email Connector allows you to integrate your BPMN service with any email server using POP3, IMAP, or SMTP. This new connector enables you to automate the retrieval, deletion, search, and organisation of emails directly within your processes.

### Unified deployment experience from Web Modeler

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2073 -->

Web Modeler Self-Managed users now benefit from a simple, secure way to deploy to clusters. During installation, configure the clusters that Web Modeler can deploy to and set the permissions for deployment in the Identity of each cluster. Cluster connection information is preconfigured within the Web Modeler so users can select which cluster to deploy to. In addition, the Web Modeler checks the Identity instance of these connected clusters to see whether the current user is authorized to deploy to that cluster and tenant. For teams using process applications, this process is further simplified, as users simply decide to deploy to dev, test, or another preauthorized stage.
