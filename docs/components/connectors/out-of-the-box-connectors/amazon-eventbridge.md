description: Send events to Amazon EventBridge from your BPMN process.
---

The **Amazon EventBridge Connector** integrates your BPMN service with [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), enabling the sending of events from your workflows for further processing or routing to other AWS services. It provides seamless event-driven integration within your business processes.

For more information, refer to the [Amazon EventBridge documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/index.html).

## Prerequisites

Before using the **Amazon EventBridge Connector**, ensure you have the necessary permissions in your AWS account to send events to EventBridge. You will need an access key and secret key of a user with the appropriate permissions. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html) for more information.

:::note
It is highly recommended not to expose your AWS IAM credentials as plain text. Instead, use Camunda secrets. Refer to our documentation on [managing secrets](/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md) to learn more.

## Create an Amazon EventBridge Connector task

To use the **Amazon EventBridge Connector** in your process, you can either change the type of existing task by clicking on it and using the wrench-shaped **Change type** context menu icon, or create a new Connector task by using the **Append Connector** context menu. Refer to our [guide on using Connectors](/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md) to learn more.

## Configure the Amazon EventBridge Connector

Follow these steps to configure the Amazon EventBridge Connector:

1. In the **Authentication** section, enter the relevant IAM key and secret pair of the user with permissions to send events to [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge).
2. In the **Configuration** section, specify the AWS region where your EventBridge resides.
3. In the **Event Details** section, provide the following information:
   - **Event bus name**: Enter the name of the destination event bus. Refer to the [Amazon EventBridge documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-event-bus.html) for more details on event buses.
   - **Source**: Enter the value that identifies the service that generated the event.
   - **Detail type**: Enter the type of event being sent. Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events-structure.html) for more information on these properties.
4. In the **Event Payload** section, enter a JSON object that contains information about the event.
5. (Optional) In the **Output Mapping** section, you can set a **Result variable** or **Result expression**. Refer to the [response mapping documentation](/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md#response-mapping) to learn more.
6. (Optional) In the **Error Handling** section, define the **Error expression** to handle errors that may occur during the event sending process. Refer to the [response mapping documentation](/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md#bpmn-errors) to learn more.
