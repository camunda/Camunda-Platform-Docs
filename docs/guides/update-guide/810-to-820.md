The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Platform 8.1.x to 8.2.0 for each component.

## Zeebe

No changes are required to update from 8.1 to 8.2.

The default [backpressure](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/operations/backpressure.md) algorithm changed from **Vegas** to **additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)**.

This may change the performance characteristics. If you have tuned your system for specific latency or throughput, we recommend you reevaluate with the new version.

### Operate

- It is recommended to follow a sequential upgrade path when upgrading to version 8.2. For example, if running on version 8.0, first upgrade to 8.1, then upgrade to 8.2.
- Migration of data during the version 8.2 upgrade could take longer than previous versions, especially for datasets containing a large amount of incidents data.
