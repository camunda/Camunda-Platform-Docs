## Milestones

You can save a snapshot of your diagram as a milestone any time.

If you make any mistakes while modeling, you can always go back to previously saved snapshots. You can also identify and compare the differences between two milestones.

Find your milestones by opening the actions menu, and clicking on **History**.

### Creating milestones

In the milestone history view, the latest version can be saved as a new milestone.

Alternatively, you can create a new milestone via the breadcrumb menu in the diagram view.

When dragging and dropping a file into the diagram view, or when using the **Replace via upload** option under the breadcrumb menu, a new milestone is created automatically.

#### Bulk milestone creation

[Process applications](/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-applications.md) are a special type of folder in Web Modeler that allows you to work on a set of related files and
[deploy](/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-applications.md#deploy-and-run-a-process-application) them together in a single bundle with just one click. This reduces the risk of having a broken deployment at runtime and makes it more convenient to deploy related files.

When creating a milestone on a main process of aÂ process application, milestones are created for all other assets in the application to make it easier to track or roll back changes.

:::note
Milestones of resources belonging to a process application are tied to the main process and cannot be modified.

### Restoring milestones

Hover over a milestone, click on the three vertical dots, and expand for more options.

### Comparing milestones

Milestones can be compared visually. By enabling the diffing feature, the currently selected milestone is compared to its predecessor.

The differences that are highlighted are only those that affect the execution of the BPMN process. Pure visual changes like position changes are not highlighted.
