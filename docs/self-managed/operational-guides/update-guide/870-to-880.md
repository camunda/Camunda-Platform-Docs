title: Update 8.7 to 8.8
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to Camunda 8.8.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to 8.8.x for each component.

## Removed deprecated OpenAPI objects

:::warning
With the Camunda 8.8 release, deprecated API objects containing number keys have been removed, including the corresponding
`application/vnd.camunda.api.keys.number+json` content type header.
:::

In previous releases, entity keys were transitioned from `number (int64)` to `string` types, and deprecated `number (int64)` keys were still supported. As of the 8.8 release, support for `number (int64)` keys has been removed.

To update to Camunda 8.8, API objects using `number` keys must be updated to use `string` keys and the `application/json` header.  

For more information about the key attribute type change, see the [8.7 API key attributes overview][camunda8-api-overview].
