description: "Use the Tasklist interface in your local language."
---

When creating processes for audiences in non-English speaking regions, you can localize Tasklist interface to the appropriate language.

To do this, design [user task forms](/guides/utilizing-forms.md) in the local language and have the Tasklist interface in the same language.

Tasklist supports the following four languages by default:

- English
- French
- German
- Spanish

The interface language is automatically determined by the user device's language settings.
The interface will default to English if the device's language is not supported.

2. Select your preferred language from the list.
3. The Tasklist interface will update to your chosen language.
