The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Platform 8.0.x to 8.1.0 for each component of the system.

## Server

### Zeebe

No changes are required to update Zeebe 8.0 to 8.1. However, there are deprecated properties you should be aware of.

:::note
Even if these parameters are deprecated, you can still use them because of the backward compatibility of the Zeebe versioning system.
:::

Deprecated properties:

- Zeebe Gateway's property `contactPoint`
  - Remove the usage of `zeebe.gateway.cluster.contactPoint` property or the `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_CONTACTPOINT` environment variable.
  - Use the `zeebe.gateway.cluster.initialContactPoints` property or the `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_INITIALCONTACTPOINTS` environment variable.

:::note
You can set the list of broker addresses here to make the start process of the Zeebe gateway more resilient. Refer to [the Zeebe gateway's configuration guide](../../../self-managed/zeebe-gateway-deployment/zeebe-gateway/#cluster-configuration) for more details.
