Identity is the component within the Camunda 8 stack responsible for authentication and authorization. It allows you to manage:

- Applications
- APIs
- Permissions
- Roles

You can use Identity for authentication with Keycloak. The following guidance can be used during platform installation and deployment:

- [Use existing Keycloak](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/guides/using-existing-keycloak.md)
- [Connect to an OIDC provider](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/guides/connect-to-an-oidc-provider.md)

If you're new to Identity, we suggest reviewing our [getting started guide](./getting-started/install-identity.md).
