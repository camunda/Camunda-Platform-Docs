Applications that leverage the Zeebe broker need to be written using a client library that implements the Zeebe gRPC API.

Zeebe provides officially supported [Java](java-client/index.md) and [Go](go-client/index.md) clients, and there are many excellent [community-supported clients](other-clients/index.md) available for other programming languages.
