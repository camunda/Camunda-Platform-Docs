title: Update 8.3 to 8.4
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.3.x to Camunda 8.4.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.3.x to 8.4.x for each component.

## Zeebe

TBD

## Changes in supported environments

- Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize now require Elasticsearch `8.9+`. Please ensure to update your Elasticsearch environment when migrating to Camunda `8.4.x`.
- Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist now support Amazon OpenSearch `2.5.x`. Note that using Amazon OpenSearch requires setting up a new Camunda installation. A migration from previous versions or Elasticsearch environments is currently not supported.

Please see [supported environments](../../../reference/supported-environments.md) for more a full overview of Camunda environment requirements.
