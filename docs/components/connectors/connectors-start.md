## About Connectors

A Connector is made up of two parts:

- The Java code used to connect to an external system. For example, the [Connector function](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md#outbound-connector-runtime-logic) for outbound Connectors.
- The user interface for modeling. This is provided by a [Connector template](manage-connector-templates.md).

If you are only using the Modeler and any of our prebuilt Connectors, you only need to understand how to configure and use a Connector in the Modeler interface, via the Properties panel.

You can use any of the available prebuilt Connectors, as well as Connectors provided by Camunda partners and community contributors in the the [Camunda Marketplace](/components/modeler/web-modeler/camunda-marketplace.md).

All Connectors are available for Camunda 8 SaaS and [Self-Managed](/self-managed/connectors-deployment/install-and-start.md).

:::note

- Each Connector comes with a [Connector template](manage-connector-templates.md) which defines how a BPMN element is shown, and how it can be configured by process developers.
- Connector templates are a specific type of [element template](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/about-templates.md), that can also be used when creating custom Connectors using the [Connector SDK](./custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md).
