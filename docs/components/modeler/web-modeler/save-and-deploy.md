title: Save and deploy your diagram
description: "If a diagram is changed and autosaved, it has no effect on your cluster."
---

Web Modeler will autosave all your changes on a diagram, moreover the changes will also be visible in real-time to any collaborators opening the same diagram.

When you change a diagram and it is autosaved, that has no effect on your cluster(s).

When you deploy the diagram, it becomes available on the selected cluster and new instances can start.

To deploy, click **Deploy Diagram**:
