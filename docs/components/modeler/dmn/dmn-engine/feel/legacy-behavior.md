title: "FEEL Engine Legacy Behavior"
---

If you come from a Camunda Platform version <= 7.12.x and already use FEEL, it might be that you need to 
migrate your DMN models. To do this, please check out the [Migration Guide], where we've documented 
all breaking changes. 

If you don't want to migrate your DMN models right now, you can also restore the legacy FEEL 
behavior by flipping a config flag:

* To see how this legacy behavior can be enabled again in the Camunda Platform, please see the
[dmnFeelEnableLegacyBehavior][legacy behavior flag] engine configuration property.
* To enable this behavior in a standalone DMN Engine setup, please refer to the `DefaultDmnEngineConfiguration`
[enableFeelLegacyBehavior][fluent feel flag setter] and [setEnableFeelLegacyBehavior][feel flag setter] 
methods

:::note Heads up!
By using the legacy FEEL Engine, the Camunda DMN Engine **only** supports `FEEL` for 
[Input Entries](#) of a decision table â€“ this corresponds to FEEL 
simple unary tests.
