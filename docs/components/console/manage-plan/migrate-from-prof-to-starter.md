:::note
Here are a few important remarks to consider before completing the migration steps:
- The migration is one way and cannot be reversed. Once you migrate to Starter, you cannot migrate back to Professional.
- Since the two plans have different types of clusters included and fees for those, we recommend comparing the old Professional plan with the new Starter plan to understand your monthly costs before the migration. 
- General users and development/production cluster reservations in the Professional plan are migrated “as is” to the Starter plan, which may result in overage costs (e.g. production clusters in Professional will be transferred to production clusters in the Starter plan). If you are not using your production cluster in the Professional plan, we recommend you delete it beforehand and create a new development cluster in the Starter plan afterward.
- Once you have edited the plan below, the changes will take effect on the first day of your next subscription period.
- If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us at starter-plan@camunda.com.
