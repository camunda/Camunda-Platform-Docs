## 8.7.0-alpha1

### Unified deployment experience for Web Modeler

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2073 -->

Self-Managed users can now enjoy the simple, secure deployment experience previously only available to SaaS. Under the hood, Web Modeler checks for connected clusters and confirms your permissions so you can only deploy to clusters you're authorized to. You just have to point and click without having to copy URLs and secrets.

### Improved activity log information in Console

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2528 -->

You can now see activities for secret changes and information about users being removed from Console in Console's activity logs.

### Flexibly scale clusters on SaaS

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2515 -->

On Camunda 8 SaaS, Enterprise customers can now flexibly increase or decrease possible capacity and performance of their cluster by adding or removing hosting packages.

### Monorepo Git Sync

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2503 -->

The Web Modeler now offers the `/path` option when using Git Sync to unlock new use cases:

- Sync with your main branch to perform visual diffing, collaboration, and manual testing in the Web Modeler. Remember not to make any changes in this branch!
- Vary the `/path` on multiple process applications to integrate the Web Modeler with your existing monorepo containing all your code assets

### Template Generator UI Integration (OpenAPI + Postman)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2049 -->

Generate a Connector Template - You can now configure and automatically generate a custom Connector template directly in the Web Modeler. Import an existing API definition, such as an OpenAPI specification or a Postman collection. For example, download a Postman collection as a YAML file, import it into the generator, and choose which methods to include in the generated template. This tool simplifies creating consistent, deployable templates, making connector setup quicker and more flexible. See Generate a Connector Template for a detailed guide on using the generator.

### Email Connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2430 -->

The Email Connector allows you to integrate your BPMN service with any email server using POP3, IMAP, or SMTP. This new connector enables you to automate the retrieval, deletion, search, and organization of emails directly within your processes.
