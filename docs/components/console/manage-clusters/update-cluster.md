Clusters can be updated to new versions of Camunda 8 manually or automatically.

At this time, updates do not trigger backups.

## Update a cluster manually

When an update is available, an **Update** button will appear. This button is not available for clusters enrolled in automatic updates.

## Automated cluster updates

You can decide if you want to have automated updates to new versions of Camunda 8 activated. You can also toggle this feature anytime later in the **Settings** tab of your cluster.
