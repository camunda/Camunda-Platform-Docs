## 8.7.0-alpha1

### Monorepo Git Sync

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2503 -->

The Web Modeler now offers the `/path` option when using Git Sync to unlock new use cases:

- Sync with your main branch to perform visual diffing, collaboration, and manual testing in the Web Modeler. Remember not to make any changes in this branch!
- Vary the `/path` on multiple process applications to integrate the Web Modeler with your existing monorepo containing all your code assets

### Template Generator UI Integration (OpenAPI + Postman)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2049 -->

### Email Connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2430 -->

The Email Connector allows you to integrate your BPMN service with any email server using POP3, IMAP, or SMTP. This new connector enables you to automate the retrieval, deletion, search, and organization of emails directly within your processes.
