:::note
The **connector SDK** is a prototype and subject to breaking changes. Use at your own risk!

The **connector SDK** allows you to easily develop own **connectors**. With the help of the SDK you can easily perform common operations, such as

- Replacing secrets
- Validating the request
- Executing the **connector** as job-worker or custom run-time, tailored toward your environment

To get started with the **connector SDK**, head over to

- [Connector SDK on github.com](https://github.com/camunda/connector-sdk)
- [Custom connector template repository on github.com](https://github.com/camunda/connector-template)
