## Connector types

Connectors are categorized by the direction data flows into or out of Camunda 8.

## How to use Connectors

When using Modeler, you can add and use any of the available [prebuilt Connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md), as well as Connectors provided by Camunda partners and community contributors in the the [Camunda Marketplace](/components/modeler/web-modeler/camunda-marketplace.md).

All Connectors are available for Camunda 8 SaaS and [Self-Managed](/self-managed/connectors-deployment/install-and-start.md).
