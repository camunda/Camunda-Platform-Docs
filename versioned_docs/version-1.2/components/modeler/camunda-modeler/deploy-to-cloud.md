Once you have established your [connection to Camunda Cloud](./connect-to-camunda-cloud.md), you can deploy your BPMN diagram.

Click the deployment icon:

![deployment icon](./img/deploy-icon.png)

:::note
The BPMN diagram must not only be valid, but also understood by the Zeebe engine. For example, if you model a service task but do not configure the element, you will get an error message during deployment.
:::

If the BPMN diagram is deployed successfully, a corresponding message displays:

![deployment successful](./img/deployment-successful.png)
