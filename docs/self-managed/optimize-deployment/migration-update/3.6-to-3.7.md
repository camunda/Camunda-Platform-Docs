:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 3.7.0 please perform the following steps: [Migration & Update Instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

Upgrade to 3.7.0 can be performed from either 3.6.0 or 3.6.3

Here you will find information about:

* limitations,
* known issues,
* changes in the supported environments,
* any unexpected behavior of Optimize (e.g due to a new feature)

## New Behavior

### Added Support for Object and List Variables
With Optimize 3.7.0, we have added support for object and list variables. Variables with type `Object` are now automatically imported and flattened into dedicated "sub variables" for each object property. If you have previously used a variable import plugin to achieve the same, you may disable this plugin after migrating to Optimize 3.7.0.  
You can find more information about importing object variables [here](../../setup/object-variables).
