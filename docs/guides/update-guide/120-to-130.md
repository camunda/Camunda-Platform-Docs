The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Cloud 1.2.x to 1.3.0 for each component of the system.

## Server

### Zeebe

:::caution
The docker image for Zeebe 1.3.0 does not set a system locale.
This can lead to user data corruption, in particular with non-ascii characters (such as umlauts) in process variables.

Please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/releases/tag/1.3.0) for mitigations and announcements
of patch releases.
:::

### Operate

With Operate 1.3, a new feature was introduced to propagate incidents from called instances to calling instances. 
This feature is only available for instances started after the version 1.3 update. Older instances will still be shown as active
even though incidents in called instances may exist.

### Tasklist

Because of internal changes in user data processing update to Tasklist 1.3 will erase all information about task assignments.
End users would need to claim their tasks again.
