**Feedback and support** can be submitted or requested via the corresponding entry in the navigation menu. If you have a **license agreement** with us, you will be redirected to the [support queue](https://jira.camunda.com/projects/SUPPORT/) at Camunda. In our Trial phase, contact can be made using the internal form:

You can also find community support for your questions, problems, and feedback on the [Camunda Forum](https://forum.camunda.io/).
