Zeebe supports the following security features:

- **[Client authorization](client-authorization.md)** - allows you to supply access credentials to the client so these can be validated by a reverse proxy placed before the gateway.
- **[Secure client-gateway communication](secure-client-communication.md)** - allows you to secure communication between clients and gateways.
- **[Secure cluster communication](secure-cluster-communication.md)** - allows you to secure communication between all nodes in a cluster.
