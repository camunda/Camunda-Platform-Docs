The Micronaut integration is a community extension that allows you to easily leverage Zeebe within your Micronaut environment.

Essentially, the integration provides a wrapper around the [Zeebe Java Client](/apis-clients/java-client/index.md).
The integration is preconfigured with sensible defaults, so that you can get started with minimal configuration: simply add a dependency, implement a worker, and add your credentials in your Micronaut project!

The Micronaut Framework is known for its efficient use of resources. Native images created with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) will reduce startup times to milliseconds.
