:::note
This feature was originally released with [8.7.0-alpha3](./880.md#870-alpha3), but is now available in 8.8.0-alpha1. For more information, see the Camunda 8.7 and 8.8 [release update blog](https://camunda.com/blog/2025/01/camunda-87-88-release-update/).
:::

Task lifecycle management is enhanced with user task listeners, allowing users to react to specific user task lifecycle events.

- Process designers can now model task listeners for different events, such as `assigning` and `completing`.
- Developers can use the same job infrastructure to activate and complete task listener jobs.
- Operations engineers can easily check details of active and completed task listeners within instances, and efficiently resolve task listener incidents.

This enhancement streamlines operations and ensures smoother incident handling, improving time to unblock process execution.

To learn more about this feature, see [user task listeners](/components/concepts/user-task-listeners.md).
