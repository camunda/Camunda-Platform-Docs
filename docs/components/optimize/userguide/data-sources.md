If you create a collection, there are no data sources available for creating reports by default. Data sources must be added by the manager to be used in reports. To do that, go to the **Data Sources** tab of the collection.

Using the **Add** button, a manager can add one or more sources to the collection. You can also select a definition that you would like to add and then select one or more tenants for that definition. You can also select the tenant first, and then select one or more definitions for that tenant.

The added sources will appear in the process/decision selection list inside the report builder where they can be used to create reports.
