Zeebe is available as Open Source Software on [GitHub](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe).

Zeebe welcomes extensions and contributions from the community!

We use both the [Camunda Community Hub](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/) and [Awesome Zeebe](https://awesome.zeebe.io/) as a place to keep track of Zeebe ecosystem contributions, such as...

- clients
- workers
- exporters
- applications

...along with other integrations such as Spring-Zeebe and the Apache Kafka connector.

If you built something for the Zeebe ecosystem, we encourage you to [add it to the Camunda Community Hub using the 'New Community Extension Proposal' template](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new-community-extension-proposal-template.md&title=).

If you're interested in contributing to the main Zeebe repository (vs. creating an extension that lives in its own repository), be sure to start with the ["Contributing to Zeebe" guide in GitHub](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
