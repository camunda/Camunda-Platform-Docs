description: Learn how to use outbound Connectors

[Outbound Connectors](/components/connectors/connector-types.md#outbound-connectors) allow workflows to trigger external systems or services.

## Creating the BPMN task

Use the change type context menu item (spanner/wrench icon) to integrate Connectors in a business model. Users can search for keywords like `REST` or `email` to find specific Connectors. To discover all available Connectors in Camunda, input the term `Connector` into the search bar.

Alternatively, you can directly create a Connector task by using the **Append Connector** context menu item. This creates a new Connector task directly following the currently selected element.

## Configuring the outbound Connector

Once a Connector task is selected, the available configuration is visible in the properties panel on the right side. The required fields are highlighted with an error message.

Fields in the properties panel marked with an equals sign inside a circle indicate that [FEEL](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md) can be used to configure the property. If the icon includes an equals sign marked with a star, FEEL is required. Using FEEL allows the user to reference process data from variables in the expression to configure the properties.

Each Connector defines its own set of properties you can fill in. Find the details for Connectors provided by Camunda in the [out-of-the-box Connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md) documentation.

## Retries

By default, Connector execution is repeated `3` times if execution fails. To change the default retries value, edit the BPMN XML file and set the `retries` attribute at the `zeebe:taskDefinition`. For example:

```xml
...
<zeebe:taskDefinition type="io.camunda:http-json:1" retries="12" />
...
```
