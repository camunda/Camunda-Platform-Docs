Two key metrics play a role in paid plans: the number of started process instances, and the number of claimed user tasks. To view these metrics across the organization, the **Organization Management** for trial plans provides a usage view for them.

Both metrics are aggregated on a monthly basis and displayed in the **Usage History**.
