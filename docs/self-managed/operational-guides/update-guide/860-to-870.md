The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.6.x to 8.7.x for each component.

## Backup

### Google Cloud Storage

Configuring a non-existing bucket for backups will not prevent Zeebe to start up anymore and will only result
in logs (at WARN) in the startup phase.

## Exported records

### `USER_TASK` records

To support User Task Listeners, some backward incompatible changes were necessary to the exported `USER_TASK` records.

#### `assignee` no longer provided in `CREATING/CREATED` events

Previously, when a user task was activating with a specified `assignee`,
we appended the following events of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `CREATED` with `assignee` property as provided

The `ASSIGNING` and `ASSIGNED` events were not appended in this case.

To support the new User Task Listeners feature, the `assignee` value will not be filled in the `CREATING` and `CREATED` events anymore.

With 8.7, the following events are now appended:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `CREATED` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `ASSIGNING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `ASSIGNED` with `assignee` property as provided

#### `ASSIGNING` has become `CLAIMING` for `CLAIM` operation

When claiming a user task, we previously appended the following records of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CLAIM`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

A new `CLAIMING` intent was introduced to distinguish between claiming and regular assigning.
We now append the following records when claiming a user task:

- `CLAIM`
- `CLAIMING`
- `ASSIGNED`

The `ASSIGNING` event is still appended for assigning a user task.
In that case, we append the following records:

- `ASSIGN`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`
