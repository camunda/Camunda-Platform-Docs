description: "Learn how Identity is bundled with your default Orchestration cluster."
---

Identity is included by default with the deployment of any [Orchestration cluster](/self-managed/reference-architecture/reference-architecture.md#orchestration-cluster). Within an Orchestration cluster, Identity provides unified, cluster-level identity management and authorizations.

Identity for Orchestration clusters is available via [Helm install](/self-managed/setup/install.md), and for local development via [Camunda 8 Run](/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/c8run.md).
