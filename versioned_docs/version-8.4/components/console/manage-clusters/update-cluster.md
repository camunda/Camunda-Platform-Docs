:::note
This action cannot be undone. Updated clusters cannot be reverted to the previous version.
:::

Clusters can be updated to new versions of Camunda 8 manually or automatically.

Clusters eligible for updates will show a button on the UI.

At this time, updates do not trigger backups, however, manual backups can be initiated through the Console Backups tab.

## Update a cluster manually

When an update is available, an **Update** button will appear. This button is not available for clusters enrolled in [automatic updates](/reference/auto-updates.md).

## Automated cluster updates

You can decide if you want to have [automated updates](/reference/auto-updates.md) to new versions of Camunda 8 activated. You can also toggle this feature anytime later in the **Settings** tab of your cluster.
