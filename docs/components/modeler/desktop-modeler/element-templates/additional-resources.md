Use the [Camunda Cloud Connect plugin](https://docs.camunda.org/cawemo/latest/technical-guide/integrations/modeler/) to integrate the Camunda Modeler with [Cawemo](https://cawemo.com/) and retrieve templates from a Cawemo catalog project.

Try playing around with custom elements and some [example templates](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/blob/master/resources/element-templates/samples.json).

If you get stuck, ask for help [in our forums](https://forum.camunda.org/c/modeler).
