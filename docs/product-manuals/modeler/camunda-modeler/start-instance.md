Once you establish your [connection to Camunda Cloud](./connect-to-camunda-cloud.md), you can start a new instance of your BPMN diagram via the play icon:

![start instance icon](./img/start-instance-icon.png)

:::note
The BPMN diagram must be deployed on your cluster before starting a new instance.
:::

If an instance is started successfully, a corresponding message is displayed:

![start instance successful](./img/start-instance-successful.png)
