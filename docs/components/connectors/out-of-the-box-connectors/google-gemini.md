description: The Gemini large language models (LLMs) that are used by Gemini for Google Cloud are trained on datasets of publicly available code, Google Cloud-specific material, and other relevant technical information in addition to the datasets used to train the Gemini [foundation models](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_1_report.pdf).

:::info
The **Google Gemini Connector** is available for `8.7.0` or later.
:::

The **Google Gemini Connector** in an outbound Connector that allows you to access to Gemini multimodal models from Google, capable of understanding virtually any input, combining different types of information in BPMN process.

## Create a Google Gemini Connector task

import ConnectorTask from '../../../components/react-components/connector-task.md'

<ConnectorTask/>

## Make your Google Gemini Connector executable

To execute the Google Gemini Connector, ensure all mandatory fields are correctly filled.

:::note
All the mandatory and non-mandatory fields and required settings depending on the operation selection you choose are covered in the upcoming sections.
:::

## 1. Authentication

Choose an authentication type from the **Type** dropdown. For details on the different authentication types, refer to the [appendix](#google-authentication-types).

## 2. Project ID

Input your google cloud project identifier.

## 3. Region

Input region where you project located (for example, `us-central1 (lowa)`, `us-west1 (Oregon)`).

## 4. Model

Select model from dropdown, list of supported models below.

- _gemini-1.5-flash-001_
- _gemini-1.5-flash-002_
- _gemini-1.5-pro-001_
- _gemini-1.5-pro-002_
- _gemini-1.0-pro-001_
- _gemini-1.0-pro-002_
- _gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001_

## 5. Prompt

Prompt should be inserted as feel expression where you can provide text and media.

- If you want to provide text to gemini, then expression should contains key _"text"_ and text data. Like _"text"_ : _"your text"_
- If you want to provide media to gemini, then expression should contains key _"mime"_ and mime type text, key _"uri"_ and media uri.
  Like _"mime"_: _"mime type"_, _"uri"_: _"your uri"_.

**Example:**

```feel
= [{"text": "who is this video about"},
{"mime": "video/*", "uri": "https://youtu.be/..."}]
```

## 6. System instructions

Input system instructions as string. System instructions inform how the model should respond. More info [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/system-instructions?hl=en).

## 7. Grounding

Grounding connects model output to verifiable sources of information. This is useful in situations where accuracy and reliability are important. [Learn more about grounding](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview?hl=en).

If you want to use grounding, select the _Grounding_ checkbox and input the path to the data store.

## 8. Safety Filter Settings

You can adjust the likelihood of receiving a model response that could contain harmful content. Content is blocked based on the probability that it's harmful.
[Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai?hl=en#safety_filters_and_attributes).

If you want to use safety filter settings, select the _Safety Filter Settings_ checkbox and select the desired level from dropdown.

:::note
By default, all filters are set to OFF.
:::

## 9. Add stop sequence

A stop sequence is a series of characters (including spaces) that stops response generation if the model encounters it.
Stop sequence should be inserted as list of string.

**Example:**

```feel
= ["text 1", "text 2"]
```

## 10. Temperature

**Temperature** controls the randomness in token selection.

- A lower temperature is good when you expect a true or correct response. A temperature of 0 means the highest probability token is usually selected.
- A higher temperature can lead to diverse or unexpected results. Some models have a higher temperature max to encourage more random responses.

## 11. Output token limit

**Output token limit** determines the maximum amount of text output from one prompt. A token is approximately four characters.

## 12. Seed

Setting a **Seed** value is useful when you make repeated requests and want the same model response.

Deterministic outcome isnâ€™t guaranteed. Changing the model or other settings can cause variations in the response
even when you use the same seed value.

## 13. Top-K

**Top-K** specifies the number of candidate tokens when the model is selecting an output token.
Use a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses.

:::note
Only _gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001_ model supports Top-K .
:::

## 14. Top-P

**Top-P** changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from most probable to least until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-p value.
For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of .3, .2, and .1 and the top-p value is .5, then the model will select either A or B as the next token (using temperature).
For the least variable results, set top-P to 0.

## 15 Functional call description

**Function calling** is a feature of Gemini models that makes it easier for developers to get structured data outputs from generative models.
**Functional call description** must be provided in fell format. [More info here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/function-calling).

:::note
It is important that all types must be registered with capslock.
:::

**Example:**

```fell
[
  {
    "name": "get_exchange_rate",
    "description":"Get the exchange rate for currencies between countries",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "OBJECT",
      "properties": {
        "currency_date": {
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "A date that must always be in YYYY-MM-DD format or the value 'latest' if a time period is not specified"
        },
        "currency_from": {
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "The currency to convert from in ISO 4217 format"
        },
        "currency_to": {
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "The currency to convert to in ISO 4217 format"
        }
      },
      "required":[
        "currency_date",
        "currency_from",
        "currency_to"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Google authentication types

The **Google Gemini Connector** currently supports two methods for authentication and authorization: based on short-lived JWT bearer token, and based on refresh token.

Google supports multiple ways to obtain both. Refer to the [official Google OAuth documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to get up-to-date instructions or refer to the examples below.

#### Example 1: Obtaining JWT bearer token with a service account

:::warning
The following code snippet is for demonstration purposes only and must not be used for real production systems due to security concerns.
For production usage, follow the [official Google guidelines](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account).
:::

Assuming you have created a service account and downloaded a JSON file with keys, run the following Python 3 snippet that prints the JWT token in the terminal:

```python
import google.auth
import google.auth.transport.requests
from google.oauth2 import service_account
# Scopes required to execute 'create' endpoind with Google Drive API
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata']
# File with keys
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'google-service-account-creds.json'
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)
auth_req = google.auth.transport.requests.Request()
credentials.refresh(auth_req)
# Print token
print(credentials.token)
```

#### Example 2: Obtaining bearer and refresh tokens with OAuth client

:::warning
The following code snippet is for demonstration purposes only and must not be used for real production systems due to security concerns.
For production usage, follow the [official Google guidelines](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).
:::

Assuming you have created an OAuth client, you can download key files from the Google [Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Run the following Python 3 snippet that prints the refresh token in the terminal:

```python
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
import pprint

SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents']
OAUTH_KEYS = './oauth-keys.json' # path to your file with OAuth credentials

def main():
    flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(OAUTH_KEYS, SCOPES)
    creds = flow.run_local_server(port=54948)
    pprint.pprint(vars(creds))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
