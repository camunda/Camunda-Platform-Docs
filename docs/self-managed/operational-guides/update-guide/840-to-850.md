### Deprecated broker health checks

The broker health check routes have moved, and the old routes are now deprecated. Specifically, the following routes will return [a status code of 301](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301) and redirect you. See the table below about the new mappings:

| Old route                               | **New route**                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/health  | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/status**    |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/ready   | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/readiness** |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/startup | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/startup**   |

Please migrate to the new routes in your deployments. **If you're using the official Helm charts, then you don't have to do anything here.**
