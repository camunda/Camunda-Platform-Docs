In the **design** mode view, business users have access to a different workspace of Web Modeler with a reduced properties panel, where only comments are shown, and in general a decluttered user interface.

All the technicalities, such as triggers to deploy the diagram or start the instance, are hidden.

Linting is disabled, and problem annotations are discarded.

The comments panel is collapsed when switching to the design mode, and if a user expands it, the state is persisted even when switching to another diagram.

As a business user, you can **link decision** models and **process** models via call activities, and you can still be a **project owner**, even if you do no implementation.

With the **design** mode view, users can model a process with ease and without feeling thrown into a complex development tool that does not speak their language, having a clear journey in place for them that incorporate focusing on modeling, sharing, and collaborating.
