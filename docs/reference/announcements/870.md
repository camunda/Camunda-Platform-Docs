## Web Modeler Deploy diagram change <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span>

With this version, we ship a breaking change to how Web Modeler **Deploy diagram** modals work. Clusters must now be proactively [configured](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from Web Modeler.

- In 8.6, you could still configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal when deploying.
- In 8.7, you can no longer configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal. You must [configure the cluster](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from this modal.
- Note that you must also be assigned the `Zeebe` [Identity role](/docs/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-role.md) to be able to deploy.

## Southeast Asia region for SaaS customers <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

SaaS customers can now create orchestration clusters in the [Singapore (asia-southeast1) region](/reference/regions.md), ensuring lower latency and improved processing speed for organizations operating in southeast Asian countries.
