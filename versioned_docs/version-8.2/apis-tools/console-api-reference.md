## Console API (REST)

For all requests, include the access token in the Authorization header: `authorization:Bearer ${TOKEN}`.

:::note
A detailed API description can be found [here](https://console.cloud.camunda.io/customer-api/openapi/docs/#/) via Swagger. With a valid access token, this offers an interactive API experience against your Camunda 8 cluster.

### Client credentials and scopes

To interact with Camunda 8 programmatically without using the Camunda 8 Console, create client credentials in the organization settings under the **Console API** tab.

Client credentials are created for an organization, and therefore can access all Camunda 8 clusters of this organization.

Scopes define the access for client credentials. A client can have one or multiple of the following permissions:

![createConsoleApiClient](../components/console/manage-organization/img/create-console-api-client.png)

A client can have one or multiple permissions from the following groups:

- **Cluster**: [Manage your clusters](../components/console/manage-clusters/create-cluster.md).
- **Zeebe Client**: [Manage API clients](../components/console/manage-clusters/manage-api-clients.md) for your cluster.
- **Web Modeler API (Beta)**: Interact with the [Web Modeler API](./web-modeler-api/index.md).
- **IP Allowlist**: Configure [IP-Allowlist](../components/console/manage-clusters/manage-ip-whitelists.md) rules.
- **Connector Secrets**: [Manage secrets](../components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md) of your clusters.
- **Members**: [Manage members](../components/console/manage-organization/manage-users.md) of your organization.
- **Backups**: Manage [backups](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/backups) of your Camunda 8 clusters (only available to Enterprise customers).

The full API description can be found [here](https://console.cloud.camunda.io/customer-api/openapi/docs/#/).

:::note
After client credentials are created, the `Client Secret` is only shown once. Save this `Client Secret` somewhere safe.
:::

### Access token

Once you have your client credentials, you can retrieve an access token using the following command:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"grant_type":"client_credentials", "audience":"api.cloud.camunda.io", "client_id":"XXX", "client_secret":"YYY"}' \
    https://login.cloud.camunda.io/oauth/token
```

:::note
Access tokens have a validity period found in the access token. After this time, a new access token must be requested.
:::

Note that the auth service has built-in rate limiting. If too many token requests are executed in a short time, the client is blocked for a certain time. Since the access tokens have a certain validity period, they must be cached on the client side.
