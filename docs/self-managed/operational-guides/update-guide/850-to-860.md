title: Update 8.5 to 8.6
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.5.x to Camunda 8.6.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.5.x to 8.6.x for each component.

## Helm chart

### Separated Ingress deprecation

The separated Ingress Helm configuration for Camunda 8 Self-Managed has been deprecated in 8.6, and will be removed from the Helm chart in 8.7. Only the combined Ingress configuration is officially supported. See the [Ingress guide](/self-managed/setup/guides/ingress-setup.md) for more information on configuring a combined Ingress setup.

### Elasticsearch nodes number

The default value of Elasticsearch deployment pods has changed from 2 to 3, and an affinity setting has been added to avoid scheduling Elasticsearch pods on the same Kubernetes worker.

## Connectors

### Kafka Connector supports Avro schema

:::caution Breaking change

The [Camunda Kafka Connector](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/kafka.md) supports [Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html) as of version 8.6.0.
This means:

- When using Connectors 8.6.0, you must use the following Kafka Connector versions:
  - For inbound connectors: 6 (or higher)
  - For outbound connector: 5 (or higher)
- When using Connectors 8.5.x (or older), you must use the following Kafka Connector versions:
  - For inbound connectors: 5 (or lower)
  - For outbound connector: 4 (or lower)

Avro schema support is the only breaking change for this Connector. If you do not use Avro schema, you can continue using the Connector as before.
