The **HTTP Webhook Connector** is an inbound Connector that allows you to start a BPMN process instance triggered by external HTTP call.

To use **HTTP Webhook Connector**, you need to have the [Zeebe](/docs/components/zeebe/zeebe-overview.md) version 8.1 higher. Once you have the updated version, you can explore the [HTTP-Webhook documentation](/docs/components/connectors/protocol/http-webhook.md) for detailed information on configuring and using this connector. Additionally, refer to the [update guide documentation](/docs/guides/update-guide/introduction.md) provided to ensure you have the latest version of the Camunda Platform.
