Zeebe supports two security features that you should be aware of:

- **[Authentication](authentication)** - allows you to secure communication between clients and gateways;
- **[Authorization](authorization)** - allows you to supply access credentials to the client so these can be validated by a reverse proxy placed before the gateway.
