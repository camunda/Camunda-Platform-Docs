Create a document automation project to automatically classify and extract data based on linked document extraction models.

## About document automation

Document automation allows you to automatically extract data from complex PDF documents.

For example, if you want to process large multi-page PDFs containing multiple document types (invoices, reports, forms), you can create a document automation project to extract the specific data you want.

- You must link at least one [document extraction](idp-document-extraction.md) project so the LLM can accurately analyze, classify, and extract document data.
- You can choose the LLM you want to use, allowing you to test different models until you find the one that best suits your budget and accuracy requirements.
- Document classification involves automatically categorizing documents into predefined classes/types, based on their content.
