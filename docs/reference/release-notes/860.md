| 11 June 2024 | - [ Camunda 8 core ](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/releases/tag/8.6.0-alpha2) <br /> - [ Connectors ](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/releases/tag/8.6.0-alpha2.1) | [Release blog](#) |

### Message queue inbound Connectors message acknowledgement configuration

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2157 -->

Enhance BPMN workflow reliability with selective message acknowledgement, enabling precise error handling and notification for unmatched messages through RabbitMQ's dead letter queue configuration. Control the message acknowledgement process so acknowledgements are sent only if the message is both correlated to a process instance and meets the activation condition.

### New inbound intermediate element template property - `Message TTL`

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/connectors/issues/1406 -->

Time-to-live (TTL) is now configurable for inbound Connectors via a property in all inbound intermediate element templates called `Message TTL`. The new default value for TTL is 0. Read more about [message buffering](/components/concepts/messages.md#message-buffering) and [message correlation](/components/concepts/messages.md#message-correlation-overview).

### Incident Copilot Alpha

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2349 -->

Let AI teach you how to prevent and fix the incidents you run into while playing your process.

- Auto-generated prompt including incident information
- Advice on how to update your model to prevent issues while developing
- An open conversation to continue asking more questions

### MS SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL outbound JDBC Connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2213 -->

Offering seamless data exchange between Camunda 8 and databases, the new database Connector for Camunda 8 simplifies data exchange with MySQL, MS SQL, and PostgreSQL databases, allowing you to read and write data directly within your Camunda processes.

This integration enables a wide range of process blueprints and use cases to be executed on the Camunda platform without any additional installation or development. With the new Camunda Connector, you can now seamlessly integrate database operations into your workflows. This feature reduces complexity, enhances security, and lowers maintenance costs by providing a robust and efficient method for data exchange directly within the Camunda platform.

### Create Camunda Wizard

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2053 -->

Camunda's Docs AI is now available while you're modeling.

Beyond the standard built-in guidance like tooltips, users who opt-in to AI features will be able to ask complex questions about how to develop their processes without leaving Modeler. The AI tool pulls best practices and technical instructions from our docs, forum posts, and blog, so you can spend less time searching for information and more time developing.

### Web Modeler Self-Managed Developer Edition (Local)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2139 -->

Web Modeler Self Managed is now free to use for anyone. Now packaged as part of Camunda's Docker distribution, you can test out Camunda's collaborative modeling and development lifecycle features before making the decision to get a license.

There is one limitation: each Modeler project can have up to five users.

### Amazon SageMaker

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2325 -->

Integrate ML cases in your existing processes with [Amazon SageMaker](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/amazon-sagemaker.md).

You can now effortlessly integrate machine learning functionalities into your workflows with the release of the Amazon SageMaker Connector. With this new Connector, directly harness Amazon SageMaker's machine learning services within Camunda, streamlining the process and allowing for greater focus on process enhancement and innovation.

### Process application MVP

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1983 -->

The [process application](/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-applications.md) is a special type of folder in Web Modeler that enables bulk actions like deploying all assets together. This reduces the risk of having a broken deployment at runtime, and makes it more convenient to deploy related `files.git`.

## 8.6.0-alpha1

| Release date | Changelog(s)                                                                                                                                                              | Release blog                                                                     |

### Process development lifecycle (PDLC) blueprint

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2014 -->

Developing and releasing Camunda processes in compliance with your organization's policies often creates a long-running, sometimes complex process across many endpoints - a great use case for an orchestrator like Camunda. Camunda is taking the first steps to orchestrate the development lifecycle using its own engine, relevant Connectors, and a [customizable blueprint](https://marketplace.camunda.com/en-US/apps/439170/cicd-pipeline) that you can modify to fit your needs.

### Process application MVP (SaaS only)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1983 -->

The [process application](/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-applications.md) is a special type of folder in Web Modeler that enables bulk actions like deploying all assets together. This reduces the risk of having a broken deployment at runtime and makes it more convenient to deploy related files.

### Instance modification as batch

<!-- Link to main page in https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3747 -->

With the new release operating mass incidents is easier with [batch instance modification](/components/operate/userguide/process-instance-batch-modification.md). If there was an issue in process execution that caused you to enter the wrong process branch or data was corrupted, you can select multiple process instances and move them to the correct place in the process.

### Relative dates in task tiles

<!-- No docs available -->

Creation, due, and follow-up dates are now shown as relative dates in task tiles (e.g. "Tomorrow" instead of "10 April 2024 - 13:34 PM").

### Anti CSRF token for Tasklist

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3672 -->

Tasklist sessions are now protected via an [anti CSRF token](/self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-configuration.md#cross-site-request-forgery-protection).
