Camunda 8 SaaS customers can enable auto-updates. When enabled, the cluster will be updated once a new patch release is available.

Auto-updates can be enabled during [cluster creation](/components/console/manage-clusters/create-cluster.md) or in the **Settings** tab.

For Camunda 8 Saas, auto-updates are only for patch releases (x.y.**z**, where **z** is a patch release).

Minor updates (x.**y**.z, where **y** is a minor release) are not eligible for auto-updates and require manual steps to initiate.
