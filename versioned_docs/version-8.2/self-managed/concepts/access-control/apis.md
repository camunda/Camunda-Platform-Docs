An API refers to a service that provides resources which can control
access via permissions.

In [Identity](/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity.md), we use APIs to attach [Permissions](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/permissions.md). Once they have been created, the
components in the Camunda Platform 8 stack are able to allow or deny users certain functionality.
