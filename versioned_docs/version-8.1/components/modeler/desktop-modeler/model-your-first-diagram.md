After [downloading](./install-the-modeler.md) and starting Desktop Modeler, you can model your first BPMN diagram. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a BPMN diagram:

![empty application](./img/empty.png)

2. View the BPMN diagram with a start event:

![new diagram](./img/new-diagram.png)

3. On the left side of the screen you will find the element palette. Drag and drop the elements onto the diagram:

![elements](./img/elements.png)

Elements that support different types can be reconfigured by clicking on the corresponding icon. In the following screenshot, a task has been added to the diagram. It can be converted to a service task, for example.

4. Use the properties panel on the right side of the page to edit the properties of the currently selected element:

5. Once you finish modeling and configuring your diagram, you can deploy it to a [Camunda Platform 8 cluster](./connect-to-camunda-platform-8.md).
