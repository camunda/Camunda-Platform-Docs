You must create a cluster if you have a new Camunda Platform 8 account. 

1. To create a cluster, click the **Clusters** tab, and click **Create New Cluster**.
2. Name your cluster. For the purpose of this guide, we recommend using the **Stable** channel, the latest generation, and the region closest to you. Click **Create**.
3. Your cluster will take a few moments to create. Check the satus on the **Clusters** page or by clicking into the cluster itself and looking at the **Applications Overview**.

Even while the cluster shows a status **Creating**, you can still proceed to begin modeling.

:::note
Zeebe must show a status of **Healthy** to properly deploy your model in future guide steps.
