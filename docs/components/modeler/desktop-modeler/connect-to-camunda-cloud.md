To connect and deploy a diagram to Camunda Cloud, follow the steps below:

:::note
The BPMN diagram must not only be valid, but also understood by the Zeebe engine. For example, if you model a service task but do not configure the element, you will get an error message during deployment.
:::

1. Select **Camunda Cloud**.
2. For the communication, you need the `Cluster Id` of your cluster and the credentials (`Client Id`, `Client Secret`) of your [API client](../../cloud-console/manage-clusters/manage-api-clients.md).
