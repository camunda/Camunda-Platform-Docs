title: Google Drive Connector
description: Create folders or files from a Google Drive template from your BPMN process.
---

The **Google Drive Connector** allows you to create empty folders or files on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) from templates from your BPMN process.

## Prerequisites

To start working with the **Google Drive Connector**, a relevant OAuth token must be configured and stored as a secret in your cluster. The token must have permission to read and create a folder and/or files from a desired Google Drive instance. Follow the steps from the [appendix](#appendix--faq) to find out more about creating an OAuth token and giving relevant permissions.

## Create a Google Drive Connector task

Currently, the Google Drive Connector supports two types of operations: create a folder and create a file from a template.

To use a **Google Drive Connector** in your process, either change the type of existing task by clicking on it and using the wrench-shaped **Change type** context menu icon or create a new Connector task by using the **Append Connector** context menu. Follow our [guide on using Connectors](../use-connectors.md) to learn more.

## Make your Google Drive Connector executable

To make the **Google Drive Connector** executable, fill out the mandatory fields highlighted in red in the properties panel.

### Create a new folder

![Google Drive Connector new folder example](../img/connectors-googledrive-new-folder-filled.png)

1. Set the required credentials in the **Authentication** section. See the [relevant appendix entry](#how-can-i-authenticate-my-connector) to find out more.
2. In the **Select Operation** section, set the field value **Operation Type** as **Create Folder**.
3. In the **Operation Details** section, set the field **Folder name** as the desired name of a folder you wish to create. For example, `MyNewFolder`. Alternatively, you could use a FEEL expression.
4. _(optional)_ In the **Operation Details** section, set the field **Parent folder ID** to the desired parent, inside which a new folder will be created. Keep in mind that if not specified, a new folder will be created in the Google Drive root folder of a user who owns the OAuth token.
5. _(optional)_ In the **Operation Details** section, you can set the **Additional properties or metadata** field to Google Drive compatible properties. For example, _description_ of the folder. This property requires FEEL input. Check [the appendix](#what-are-the-limitations-of-the-additional-properties-or-metadata) for known values and limitations.

### Create a new file from a template

![Google Drive Connector new file from template example](../img/connectors-googledrive-new-file-filled.png)

1. Set the required credentials in the **Authentication** section. See the [relevant appendix entry](#how-can-i-authenticate-my-connector) to find out more.
2. In the **Select Operation** section, set the field value **Operation Type** as **Create File from template**.
3. In the **Operation Details** section, set the field **File name** as the desired name of a folder you wish to create. You can use FEEL expressions here.
4. In the **Operation Details** section, set the field **Template ID** of the desired template.
5. _(optional)_ In the **Operation Details** section, set the field **Parent folder ID** to the desired parent, inside which a new file will be created. Keep in mind that if not specified, a new folder will be created in the Google Drive root folder of a user who owns the OAuth token.
6. In the **Operation Details** section, set the field **Template variables** as desired variables that will be applied to the template. The template variables are compatible with the Google Docs [Requests API](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/documents/request). This property requires FEEL input.
7. _(optional)_ In the **Operation Details** section, you can set the **Additional properties or metadata** field to Google Drive compatible properties. This property requires FEEL input. Check [the appendix](#what-are-the-limitations-of-the-additional-properties-or-metadata) for known values and limitations.

## Google Drive Connector response

The **Google Drive Connector** exposes Google Drive API response as a local variable called response.
The following fields are available in the response variable:

- `googleDriveResourceId` - ID of the newly created resource.
- `googleDriveResourceUrl` - Human-readable URL of the newly created resource.

You can use an output mapping to map the response:

1. Use **Result Variable** to store the response in a process variable. For example, `myResultVariable`.
2. Use **Result Expression** to map fields from the response into process variables. For example:

```
= {
  "myNewReportFolderId": response.googleDriveResourceId,
  "myNewReportFolderUrl": response.googleDriveResourceUrl
}
```

## Appendix & FAQ

### What Google API does the Google Drive Connector use to create a folder?

The **Google Drive Connector** uses the Google Drive [`Files:Create`](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/create) API endpoint.

### What Google API does the Google Drive Connector use to create a file from template?

The **Google Drive Connector** uses the Google Drive [`Files:Copy`](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/copy) API endpoint to copy an original template. Afterwards, the **Google Drive Connector** utilizes Google Docs [Merge](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/merge) approach via [`Documents:BatchUpdate`](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/documents/batchUpdate) Google Docs API method.

### How can I authenticate my Connector?

The **Google Drive Connector** currently supports two ways of authentication and authorization: based on short-lived JWT bearer token, and based on refresh token.

Google supports multiple ways to obtain both. Refer to the [official Google OAuth documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to get up-to-date instructions or see examples below.

You also enable _Google Docs API_ and _Google Drive API_ for every client intended to use. You can do this at the [Google Cloud API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) page.

#### Example 1: Obtaining JWT bearer token with a service account

![Bearer Auth](../img/connectors-googledrive-jwt-bearer.png)

See [related article](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account).

:::warning
The following code snippets are for demonstration purposes only and must not be used for real production systems due to security concerns.
:::

Assuming you have created a service account and downloaded a JSON file with keys, run the following code snippet that prints the JWT token in the terminal:

```python
import google.auth
import google.auth.transport.requests
from google.oauth2 import service_account
# Scopes required to execute 'create' endpoind with Google Drive API
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata']
# File with keys
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'google-service-account-creds.json'
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)
auth_req = google.auth.transport.requests.Request()
credentials.refresh(auth_req)
# Print token
print(credentials.token)
```

#### Example 2: Obtaining bearer and refresh tokens with OAuth client

![Refresh Auth](../img/connectors-googledrive-jwt-refresh.png)

See [related article](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).

:::warning
The following code snippets are for demonstration purposes only and must not be used for real production systems due to security concerns.
:::

Assuming you have created an OAuth client, you can download key files from the Google [Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Run the following code snippet that prints the refresh token in the terminal:

```python
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
import pprint

SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents']
OAUTH_KEYS = './oauth-keys.json' # path to your file with OAuth credentials

def main():
    flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(OAUTH_KEYS, SCOPES)
    creds = flow.run_local_server(port=54948)
    pprint.pprint(vars(creds))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Where do I get a parent folder ID?

It is in the URL.

![Google Drive Connector get parent folder ID](../img/connectors-googledrive-get-parent-folder-id.png)

### How do I set additional properties or metadata?

You can set any property from the Google Drive [Create API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/create).
For example:

```
= {
  "description":"myDescription"
}
```

The unknown or mistyped properties will be ignored.

### What are the limitations of the additional properties or metadata?

Some properties are applicable only for the token owners, like `folderColorRgb` and `starred`.

### Where do I get Template ID?

It is in the URL.

![Google Drive Connector get template ID](../img/connectors-googledrive-get-template-id.png)

### Can you show me an example of a valid template?

A valid template looks like the following screenshot.

![Google Drive Connector document template example](../img/connectors-googledrive-template-example.png)

Now, in the **Template variables** field we can apply the following FEEL JSON object which must be compatible with the Google Docs Requests API:

```
= {
  "requests":[
    {
      "replaceAllText":{
        "containsText":{
          "text":"{{DocumentDate}}",
          "matchCase":"true"
        },
        "replaceText":today()
      }
    },
    {
      "replaceAllText":{
        "containsText":{
          "text":"{{RecipientFullName}}",
          "matchCase":"true"
        },
        "replaceText":"John W. Doe"
      }
    },
    {
      "replaceAllText":{
        "containsText":{
          "text":"{{RecipientAddress}}",
          "matchCase":"true"
        },
        "replaceText":"Zweibrückenstraße 1845, 80000 Munich"
      }
    },
    {
      "replaceAllText":{
        "containsText":{
          "text":"{{RecipientShortName}}",
          "matchCase":"true"
        },
        "replaceText":"Mr. Doe"
      }
    },
    {
      "replaceAllText":{
        "containsText":{
          "text":"{{ApplicationNumber}}",
          "matchCase":"true"
        },
        "replaceText":"0123456789"
      }
    },
    {
      "replaceAllText":{
        "containsText":{
          "text":"{{SigneeName}}",
          "matchCase":"true"
        },
        "replaceText":"Jane T. Doe"
      }
    },
    {
      "replaceAllText":{
        "containsText":{
          "text":"{{CompanyName}}",
          "matchCase":"true"
        },
        "replaceText":"Good Company Inc."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The result should be as follows:
