# Contact

There are a few different channels you can reach us based on your needs:

- We encourage everyone to participate in our **community** via the [Camunda community forum](https://forum.camunda.io/), where you can exchange ideas with other Camunda users, as well as Camunda employees. For all other Camunda community programs and resources, visit our [Camunda Developer Hub](https://camunda.com/developers).

- We welcome your **bug** reports and **feature requests** through our community channels mentioned above.

- For **security-related issues**, review our [security notices](../docs/reference/notices) for the most up-to-date information on known issues and steps to report a vulnerability so we can solve the problem as quickly as possible. Do not use GitHub for security-related issues.

- **Feedback and support** can be submitted or requested via JIRA by following our [Enterprise support process](https://docs.camunda.org/enterprise/support/). All users can also find feedback and support options in the Help Center or [Camunda community forum](https://forum.camunda.io/).
