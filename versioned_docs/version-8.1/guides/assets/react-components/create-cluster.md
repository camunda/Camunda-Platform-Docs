To deploy and run your process, you must create a cluster in Camunda 8.

1. To create a cluster, navigate to **Console**, click the **Clusters** tab, and click **Create New Cluster**.
2. Name your cluster. For the purpose of this guide, we recommend using the **Stable** channel and the latest generation. Click **Create**.
3. Your cluster will take a few moments to create. Check the status on the **Clusters** page or by clicking into the cluster itself and looking at the **Applications Overview**.

Even while the cluster shows a status **Creating**, you can still proceed to begin modeling.

:::note
Zeebe must show a status of **Healthy** to properly deploy your model in future guide steps.
