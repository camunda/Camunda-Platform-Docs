Under the **Billing section**, the organization owners and admins can set up alerts for **Process Instances** and **Decision Instances**.
Usage is calculated daily and when the threshold for an alert is met, all org owners and admins will be alerted via email and in-app notification.

:::note
The threshold set is calculated on a percentage ratio between your consumption and the amounts included in your plan.
For example, when a threshold is set at 50% for a plan that includes 200 process instances, an alert will be sent when 100 process instances have been reached.
