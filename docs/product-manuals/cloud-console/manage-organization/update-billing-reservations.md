## Managing hardware packages

Once signed up for the **Professional Plan**, you have access to the **Billing** page.

- The created process instances from the current period are displayed at the top of the page.
- Find a history of the metrics on a monthly basis at the bottom of the page.
- View how many hardware packages are included and change the reservations for additional hardware packages on the right side of the page.

Reservations control how many clusters you can deploy. Increasing the number of reservations allows you to deploy more clusters, while decreasing the number of reservations does the opposite.

You can access the **Billing** page by selecting the **Organization Settings** in the Camunda Cloud Console navigation bar.
