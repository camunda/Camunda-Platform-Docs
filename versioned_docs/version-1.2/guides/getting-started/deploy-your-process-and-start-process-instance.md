## Prerequisites

- Console Modeler or [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/)

:::note

BPMN diagrams must be created for the process engine they intend to be deployed on. You cannot currently run a BPMN diagram modeled for Camunda Platform in Camunda Cloud, or vice versa.

## Deploy and start your process instance

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="modeler" defaultValue="console" values={
[
{label: 'Console Modeler', value: 'console', },
{label: 'Camunda Modeler', value: 'desktop', },
]
}>

<TabItem value='console'>

You can now use the **Save & Deploy** option in the **Execute** menu to deploy the newly-created process to your cluster.

![console-modeler-deploy](../../components/modeler/cloud-modeler/img/save-and-deploy.png)

Deployment can take a few seconds, but you should get a confirmation for successful deployment.

![console-modeler-deploy-successfull](../../components/modeler/cloud-modeler/img/save-and-deploy-successful.png)

You can now start a new process instance. For this example, you can start an instance with an empty payload.

![console-modeler-start-instance](../../components/modeler/cloud-modeler/img/start-process-instance-variables.png)

Once the instance is started, you'll receive a confirmation with a link to open Operate.

![console-modeler-start-instance-done](../../components/modeler/cloud-modeler/img/start-process-instance-done.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='desktop'>

Take the following steps:

1. On the right side of the navigation menu, note the buttons for deploying and starting processes.

2. In the deployment dialog, the connection information must now be specified: `Cluster Id`, `Client Id`, and `Client Secret`.

`Client Id` and `Cluster Id` can be retrieved by clicking on **View** on the client in the **API** tab.

![cluster-details-created-client-view](./img/cluster-details-created-client-view.png)

The `Client Secret` can be retrieved from the downloaded connection file:

```bash
grep SECRET  ~/Downloads/CamundaCloudMgmtAPI-Client-test-client.txt
export ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECRET='zbzsZI_6UnCsH_CIo0lNUN8qGyvLJr9VrH77ewNm8Oq3elvhPvV7g.QmJGydzOLo'
```

3. Click **Deploy** to deploy the process. Use **Play** from the navigation to start a new instance.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
