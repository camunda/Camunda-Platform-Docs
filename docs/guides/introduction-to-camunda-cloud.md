[Camunda Platform 8](https://camunda.io) delivers scalable, on-demand process automation as-a-service. Camunda Platform 8 is combined with powerful execution engines for BPMN processes and DMN decisions, and paired with tools for collaborative modeling, operations, and analytics.

Camunda Platform 8 consists of six [components](../components/overview.md):

- [Console](../components/console/introduction.md) - Configure and deploy clusters with Console.
- [Web Modeler](../components/modeler/about.md) - Collaborate, model processes, and deploy or start new instances, all without leaving Camunda Platform 8.
- [Zeebe](../components/zeebe/zeebe-overview.md) - The cloud-native process engine of Camunda Platform 8.
- [Tasklist](../components/tasklist/introduction.md) - Complete tasks which require human input.
- [Operate](../components/operate/index.md) - Manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your processes.
- [Optimize](../components/optimize/what-is-optimize.md) - Improve your processes by identifying constraints in your system.

Camunda Platform 8 can be used with both [Desktop Modeler](../components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler.md) and [Web Modeler](../components/modeler/web-modeler/new-web-modeler.md).

In this section of the Camunda Platform 8 documentation, you'll find guides for getting started with Camunda Platform 8 before learning more about each individual [component](../components/overview.md).
