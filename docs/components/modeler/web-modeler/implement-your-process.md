In the **implementation** mode view, developers have access to a full, implementation-focused workspace of Web Modeler.

The view has all possible implementation details, and the problems panel shows all implementation problems that need fixing before deployment.

The properties panel automatically opens when switching to the implementation mode, and if collapsed, it stays collapsed as long as you navigate between diagrams.

Developers can switch between the modes as they like, and when they open a process template, it opens in implementation.
