Zeebe is available as Open Source Software on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe).

Zeebe welcomes extensions and contributions from the community!

We use [Awesome Zeebe](https://awesome.zeebe.io/) as a place to keep track of Zeebe ecosystem contributions, such as...

- clients
- workers
- exporters
- applications

...along with other integrations such as Spring-Zeebe and the Apache Kafka connector.

If you built something for the Zeebe ecosystem, we encourage you to [add it to Awesome Zeebe via pull request](https://github.com/zeebe-io/awesome-zeebe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're interested in contributing to the main Zeebe repository (vs. creating an extension that lives in its own repository), be sure to start with the ["Contributing to Zeebe" guide in GitHub](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
