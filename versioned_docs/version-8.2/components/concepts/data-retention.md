In Camunda 8 SaaS, the following data retention strategies are implemented. This is necessary as the amount of data can grow significantly overtime. These settings are a balance between performance and usability.

## Default retention time of each application

The following time-to-live settings are configured in SaaS for each application. These are the defaults for our Starter and Enterprise plans.

- **Operate**: 30 days
- **Optimize**: 180 days
- **Tasklist**: 30 days
- **Zeebe**: 7 days
