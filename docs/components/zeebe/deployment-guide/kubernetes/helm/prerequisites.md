To use Kubernetes, you need to have the following tools installed in your local environment:

- `kubectl`: Kubernetes Control CLI tool, installed and connected to your cluster
- `helm`: Kubernetes Helm CLI tool

You also need a Kubernetes Cluster, here you have several options:

- Local for development you can use: [Kubernetes KIND](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind), Minikube, MicroK8s.
- Remote: Google GKE, Azure AKS, Amazon EKS, etc.

:::note
You can use free trials from different cloud providers to create a Kubernetes cluster to test Zeebe in the cloud.
