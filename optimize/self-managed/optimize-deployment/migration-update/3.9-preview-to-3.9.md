## Changes in supported environments

Optimize now requires at least Elasticsearch `7.13.0`.
See the [Supported Environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments) sections for the full range of supported versions.

If you need to update your Elasticsearch cluster, refer to the general [Elasticsearch Update Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html) on how to do that. Usually, the only thing you need to do is perform a [rolling update](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rolling-upgrades.html).
