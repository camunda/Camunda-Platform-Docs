title: Update 8.5 to 8.6
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.5.x to Camunda 8.6.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.5.x to 8.6.x for each component.

## Helm chart

### Separated Ingress deprecation

The separated Ingress Helm configuration for Camunda 8 Self-Managed has been deprecated in 8.6, and will be removed from the Helm chart in 8.7. Only the combined Ingress configuration is officially supported. See the [Ingress guide](/self-managed/setup/guides/ingress-setup.md) for more information on configuring a combined Ingress setup.

### Elasticsearch nodes number

The default value of Elasticsearch deployment pods has changed from 2 to 3, and an affinity setting has been added to avoid scheduling Elasticsearch pods on the same Kubernetes worker.

## Connectors

### Kafka Connector - Avro schema

:::caution Breaking change

The Camunda Kafka Connector supports [Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html) as of version 8.6.0.
This means:

- When using Connectors 8.6.0, you must use the following Kafka Connectors versions:
  - For inbound connectors: 6 (or higher)
  - For outbound connector: 5 (or higher)
- When using Connectors 8.5.x (or older), you must use the following Kafka Connectors versions:
  - For inbound connectors: 5 (or lower)
  - For outbound connector: 4 (or lower)
    :::

To add more information about the changes in the Kafka Connector, the only breaking change is the support for Avro schema.
If you don't use Avro schema, you can continue using the Kafka Connector as before.
